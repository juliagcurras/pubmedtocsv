AB  - Glycolipid metabolism disorder are major threats to human health and life. 
      Genetic, environmental, psychological, cellular, and molecular factors contribute 
      to their pathogenesis. Several studies demonstrated that neuroendocrine axis 
      dysfunction, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, chronic inflammatory response, 
      and gut microbiota dysbiosis are core pathological links associated with it. 
      However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of 
      glycolipid metabolism disorder remain to be elucidated. Progress in 
      high-throughput technologies has helped clarify the pathophysiology of glycolipid 
      metabolism disorder. In the present review, we explored the ways and means by 
      which genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiomics 
      could help identify novel candidate biomarkers for the clinical management of 
      glycolipid metabolism disorder. We also discuss the limitations and recommended 
      future research directions of multi-omics studies on these diseases.

TI  - Functional Foods and Lifestyle Approaches for Diabetes Prevention and Management.
LID - 10.3390/nu9121310 [doi]

AB  - Functional foods contain biologically active ingredients associated with 
      physiological health benefits for preventing and managing chronic diseases, such 
      as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A regular consumption of functional foods may 
      be associated with enhanced anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitivity, 
      and anti-cholesterol functions, which are considered integral to prevent and 
      manage T2DM. Components of the Mediterranean diet (MD)-such as fruits, 
      vegetables, oily fish, olive oil, and tree nuts-serve as a model for functional 
      foods based on their natural contents of nutraceuticals, including polyphenols, 
      terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, pigments, and unsaturated fatty 
      acids. Polyphenols within MD and polyphenol-rich herbs-such as coffee, green tea, 
      black tea, and yerba maté-have shown clinically-meaningful benefits on metabolic 
      and microvascular activities, cholesterol and fasting glucose lowering, and 
      anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation in high-risk and T2DM patients. However, 
      combining exercise with functional food consumption can trigger and augment 
      several metabolic and cardiovascular protective benefits, but it is 
      under-investigated in people with T2DM and bariatric surgery patients. Detecting 
      functional food benefits can now rely on an "omics" biological profiling of 
      individuals' molecular, genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, 
      but is under-investigated in multi-component interventions. A personalized 
      approach for preventing and managing T2DM should consider biological and 
      behavioral models, and embed nutrition education as part of lifestyle diabetes 
      prevention studies. Functional foods may provide additional benefits in such an 
      approach.

TI  - Mesenchymal stromal cells ameliorate diabetes-induced muscle atrophy through 
      exosomes by enhancing AMPK/ULK1-mediated autophagy.
PG  - 915-929
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.13177 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes and obesity are associated with muscle atrophy that reduces 
      life quality and lacks effective treatment. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based 
      therapy can ameliorate high fat-diet (HFD) and immobilization (IM)-induced muscle 
      atrophy in mice. However, the effect of MSCs on muscle atrophy in type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) and the potential mechanism is unclear. Here, we evaluated the 
      efficacy and explored molecular mechanisms of human umbilical cord MSCs (hucMSCs) 
      and hucMSC-derived exosomes (MSC-EXO) on diabetes- and obesity-induced muscle 
      atrophy. METHODS: Diabetic db/db mice, mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD), mice 
      with hindlimb immobilization (IM), and C2C12 myotubes were used to explore the 
      effect of hucMSCs or MSC-EXO in alleviating muscle atrophy. Grip strength test 
      and treadmill running were used to measure skeletal muscle strength and 
      performance. Body composition, muscle weight, and muscle fibre cross-sectional 
      area (CSA) was used to evaluate muscle mass. RNA-seq analysis of tibialis 
      anterior (TA) muscle and Western blot analysis of muscle atrophy signalling, 
      including MuRF1 and Atrogin 1, were performed to investigate the underlying 
      mechanisms. RESULTS: hucMSCs increased grip strength (P = 0.0256 in db/db mice, 
      P = 0.012 in HFD mice, P = 0.0097 in IM mice), running endurance (P = 0.0154 in 
      HFD mice, P = 0.0006 in IM mice), and muscle mass (P = 0.0004 in db/db mice, 
      P = 0.0076 in HFD mice, P = 0.0144 in IM mice) in all models tested, with 
      elevated CSA of muscle fibres (P < 0.0001 in db/db mice and HFD mice, P = 0.0088 
      in IM mice) and reduced Atrogin1 (P = 0.0459 in db/db mice, P = 0.0088 in HFD 
      mice, P = 0.0016 in IM mice) and MuRF1 expression (P = 0.0004 in db/db mice, 
      P = 0.0077 in HFD mice, P = 0.0451 in IM mice). MSC-EXO replicated all these 
      hucMSC-mediated changes (P = 0.0103 for grip strength, P = 0.013 for muscle mass, 
      P < 0.0001 for CSA of muscle fibres, P = 0.0171 for Atrogin1 expression, and 
      P = 0.006 for MuRF1 expression). RNA-seq revealed that hucMSCs activated the 
      AMPK/ULK1 signalling and enhanced autophagy. Knockdown of AMPK or inhibition of 
      autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) diminished the beneficial anti-atrophy 
      effects of hucMSCs or MSC-EXO. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that human 
      umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells mitigate diabetes- and obesity-induced 
      muscle atrophy via enhancing AMPK/ULK1-mediated autophagy through exosomes, with 
      implications of applying hucMSCs or hucMSC-derived exosomes to treat muscle 
      atrophy.

AB  - PURPOSE: No evidence exists as to whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) impairs 
      clinical outcome from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with solid 
      tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a large cohort of ICI recipients treated at 21 
      institutions from June 2014 to June 2020, we studied whether patients on 
      glucose-lowering medications (GLM) for T2DM had shorter overall survival (OS) and 
      progression-free survival (PFS). We used targeted transcriptomics in a subset of 
      patients to explore differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of patients 
      with or without diabetes. RESULTS: A total of 1,395 patients were included. 
      Primary tumors included non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 54.7%), melanoma 
      (24.7%), renal cell (15.0%), and other carcinomas (5.6%). After multivariable 
      analysis, patients on GLM (n = 226, 16.2%) displayed an increased risk of death 
      [HR, 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.07-1.56] and disease progression/death 
      (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43) independent of number of GLM received. We matched 
      92 metformin-exposed patients with 363 controls and 78 patients on other oral GLM 
      or insulin with 299 control patients. Exposure to metformin, but not other GLM, 
      was associated with an increased risk of death (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16-2.03) and 
      disease progression/death (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04-1.72). Patients with T2DM with 
      higher pretreatment glycemia had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 
      0.04), while exploratory tumoral transcriptomic profiling in a subset of patients 
      (n = 22) revealed differential regulation of innate and adaptive immune pathways 
      in patients with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients on GLM experienced 
      worse outcomes from immunotherapy, independent of baseline features. Prospective 
      studies are warranted to clarify the relative impact of metformin over a 
      preexisting diagnosis of T2DM in influencing poorer outcomes in this population.

TI  - m(6)A reader YTHDC1 modulates autophagy by targeting SQSTM1 in diabetic skin.
PG  - 1318-1337
LID - 10.1080/15548627.2021.1974175 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of macroautophagy/autophagy contributes to the delay of wound 
      healing in diabetic skin. N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modification is known 
      to play a critical role in regulating autophagy. In this study, it was found that 
      SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1), an autophagy receptor, was significantly 
      downregulated in two human keratinocyte cells lines with short-term high-glucose 
      treatment, as well as in the epidermis of diabetic patients and a db/db mouse 
      model with long-term hyperglycemia. Knockdown of SQSTM1 led to the impairment of 
      autophagic flux, which was consistent with the results of high-glucose treatment 
      in keratinocytes. Moreover, the m(6)A reader protein YTHDC1 (YTH domain 
      containing 1), which interacted with SQSTM1 mRNA, was downregulated in 
      keratinocytes under both the acute and chronic effects of hyperglycemia. 
      Knockdown of YTHDC1 affected biological functions of keratinocytes, which 
      included increased apoptosis rates and impaired wound-healing capacity. In 
      addition, knockdown of endogenous YTHDC1 resulted in a blockade of autophagic 
      flux in keratinocytes, while overexpression of YTHDC1 rescued the blockade of 
      autophagic flux induced by high glucose. In vivo, knockdown of endogenous Ythdc1 
      or Sqstm1 inhibited autophagy in the epidermis and delayed wound healing. 
      Interestingly, we found that a decrease of YTHDC1 drove SQSTM1 mRNA degradation 
      in the nucleus. Furthermore, the results revealed that YTHDC1 interacted and 
      cooperated with ELAVL1/HuR (ELAV like RNA binding protein 1) in modulating the 
      expression of SQSTM1. Collectively, this study uncovered a previously 
      unrecognized function for YTHDC1 in modulating autophagy via regulating the 
      stability of SQSTM1 nuclear mRNA in diabetic keratinocytes.Abbreviations: ACTB:

TI  - Mitophagy-mediated adipose inflammation contributes to type 2 diabetes with 
      hepatic insulin resistance.

AB  - White adipose tissues (WAT) play crucial roles in maintaining whole-body energy 
      homeostasis, and their dysfunction can contribute to hepatic insulin resistance 
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanisms underlying these 
      alterations remain unknown. By analyzing the transcriptome landscape in human 
      adipocytes based on available RNA-seq datasets from lean, obese, and T2DM 
      patients, we reveal elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway 
      and NF-κB signaling with altered fatty acid metabolism in T2DM adipocytes. Mice 
      with adipose-specific deletion of mitochondrial redox Trx2 develop hyperglycemia, 
      hepatic insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Trx2-deficient WAT exhibited 
      excessive mitophagy, increased inflammation, and lipolysis. Mechanistically, 
      mitophagy was induced through increasing ROS generation and NF-κB-dependent 
      accumulation of autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1, which recruits damaged 
      mitochondria with polyubiquitin chains. Importantly, administration of ROS 
      scavenger or NF-κB inhibitor ameliorates glucose and lipid metabolic disorders 
      and T2DM progression in mice. Taken together, this study reveals a previously 
      unrecognized mechanism linking mitophagy-mediated adipose inflammation to T2DM 
      with hepatic insulin resistance.

TI  - PRDM16 exerts critical role in myocardial metabolism and energetics in type 2 
      diabetes induced cardiomyopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased over 
      the past decades. Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of death in 
      T2DM patients, however, the mechanism underlying DCM remains largely unknown. 
      Here, we aimed to investigate the role of cardiac PR-domain containing 16 
      (PRDM16) in T2DM. METHODS: We modeled mice with cardiac-specific deletion of 
      Prdm16 by crossing the floxed Prdm16 mouse model with the cardiomyocyte-specific 
      Cre transgenic mouse. The mice were continuously fed a chow diet or high-fat diet 
      combining with streptozotocin (STZ) for 24 weeks to establish a T2DM model. DB/DB 
      and adequate control mice were given a single intravenous injection of 
      adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) carrying cardiac troponin T (cTnT) 
      promoter-driven small hairpin RNA targeting PRDM16 (AAV9-cTnT-shPRDM16) from the 
      retro-orbital venous plexus to knockout Prdm16 in the myocardium. There were at 
      least 12 mice in each group. Mitochondrial morphology and function were detected 
      using transmission electron microscopy, western blot determining the protein 
      level of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, mitotracker staining and 
      Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit. Untargeted metabolomics analysis and 
      RNA-seq analysis were performed to determine the molecular and metabolic changes 
      associated with Prdm16 deficiency. BODIPY and TUNEL staining were used to detect 
      lipid uptake and apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation and ChIP assays were conducted 
      to examine the potential underlying mechanism. RESULTS: Prdm16 cardiac-specific 
      deficiency accelerated cardiomyopathy and worsened cardiac dysfunction in mice 
      with T2DM, aggravating mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis both in vivo and 
      in vitro, while PRDM16 overexpression the deterioration. Prdm16 deficiency also 
      caused cardiac lipid accumulation resulting in metabolic and molecular 
      alterations in T2DM mouse models. Co-IP and luciferase assays confirmed that 
      PRDM16 targeted and regulated the transcriptional activity, expression and 
      interaction of PPAR-α and PGC-1α, while the overexpression of PPAR-α and PGC-1α 
      reversed Prdm16 deficiency-induced cellular dysfunction in T2DM model. Moreover, 
      PRDM16 regulated PPAR-α and PGC-1α and affected mitochondrial function by mainly 
      depending on epigenetic regulation of H3K4me3. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      suggest that PRDM16 exerted its protective role in myocardial lipid metabolism 
      and mitochondrial function in T2DM in a histone lysine methyltransferase 
      activity-dependent manner by regulating PPAR-α and PGC-1α.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is characterized by the age-associated loss of skeletal 
      muscle mass and strength that develops progressively and plays an important role 
      in the disability of the elderly. It has received growing attention over the last 
      decade and has been implicated as both a cause and consequence of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM). The existence of T2DM could increase the risk of developing 
      sarcopenia through multiple mechanisms including advanced glycation end-product 
      accumulation. Meanwhile, sarcopenia would alter glucose disposal and may 
      contribute to the development and progression of T2DM due to reduced muscle mass. 
      METHODS: We implemented transcriptomic analysis of skeletal muscle biopsy 
      specimens in sarcopenia patients and proliferating myoblasts or differentiated 
      myotubes from individuals with T2DM. Related microarray data were selected from 
      Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to screen the genes, which were differentially 
      expressed for sarcopenia and T2DM. Multiple combinatorial statistical methods and 
      bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the common DEGs. Meanwhile, functional 
      enrichment analysis was also carried out. Furthermore, we constructed the 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI), as well as transcription factor (TF)-gene 
      interactions network and TF-miRNA coregulatory network. Finally, based on the 
      common DEGs, drug compounds were speculated using the Drug Signatures database 
      (DSigDB). RESULTS: A total of 1765 and 2155 DEGs of sarcopenia and T2DM were 
      screened, respectively. 15 common genes (LXN, CIB2, PEA15, KANK2, FGD1, NMRK1, 
      PLCB1, SEMA4G, ADARB1, UPF3A, CSTB, COL3A1, CD99, ETV3, FJX1) correlated with 
      sarcopenia and T2DM simultaneously were then identified, and 3 genes (UPF3A, CSTB 
      and PEA15) of them were regarded as hub genes. Functional enrichment analysis 
      revealed several shared pathways between two diseases. In addition, according to 
      the TF-gene interactions network and TF-miRNA coregulatory network, part of TF 
      and miRNA may be identified as key regulator in sarcopenia and T2DM at the same 
      time (e.g., CREM and miR-155). Notably, drug compounds for T2DM and sarcopenia 
      were also suggested, such as coenzyme Q10. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that 
      sarcopenia and T2DM may share similar pathogenesis and provided new biological 
      targets and ideas for early diagnosis and effective treatment of sarcopenia and 
      T2DM.

TI  - Resolution of NASH and hepatic fibrosis by the GLP-1R/GcgR dual-agonist 
      Cotadutide via modulating mitochondrial function and lipogenesis.
PG  - 413-431
LID - 10.1038/s42255-020-0209-6 [doi]
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis are highly associated with 
      obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cotadutide, a GLP-1R/GcgR agonist, was 
      shown to reduce blood glycemia, body weight and hepatic steatosis in patients 
      with T2DM. Here, we demonstrate that the effects of Cotadutide to reduce body 
      weight, food intake and improve glucose control are predominantly mediated 
      through the GLP-1 signaling, while, its action on the liver to reduce lipid 
      content, drive glycogen flux and improve mitochondrial turnover and function are 
      directly mediated through Gcg signaling. This was confirmed by the identification 
      of phosphorylation sites on key lipogenic and glucose metabolism enzymes in liver 
      of mice treated with Cotadutide. Complementary metabolomic and transcriptomic 
      analyses implicated lipogenic, fibrotic and inflammatory pathways, which are 
      consistent with a unique therapeutic contribution of GcgR agonism by Cotadutide 
      in vivo. Significantly, Cotadutide also alleviated fibrosis to a greater extent 
      than Liraglutide or Obeticholic acid (OCA), despite adjusting dose to achieve 
      similar weight loss in 2 preclinical mouse models of NASH. Thus Cotadutide, via 
      direct hepatic (GcgR) and extra-hepatic (GLP-1R) effects, exerts multi-factorial 
      improvement in liver function and is a promising therapeutic option for the 
      treatment of steatohepatitis.

TI  - Evogliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, prevents diabetic cardiomyopathy by alleviating 
      cardiac lipotoxicity in db/db mice.
PG  - 767-778
LID - 10.1038/s12276-023-00958-6 [doi]
AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering drugs for type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We investigated whether evogliptin® (EVO), a DPP-4 
      inhibitor, could protect against diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and the underlying 
      mechanisms. Eight-week-old diabetic and obese db/db mice were administered EVO 
      (100 mg/kg/day) daily by oral gavage for 12 weeks. db/db control mice and 
      C57BLKS/J as wild-type (WT) mice received equal amounts of the vehicle. In 
      addition to the hypoglycemic effect, we examined the improvement in cardiac 
      contraction/relaxation ability, cardiac fibrosis, and myocardial hypertrophy by 
      EVO treatment. To identify the mechanisms underlying the improvement in diabetic 
      cardiomyopathy by EVO treatment, its effect on lipotoxicity and the mitochondrial 
      damage caused by lipid droplet accumulation in the myocardium were analyzed. EVO 
      lowered the blood glucose and HbA1c levels and improved insulin sensitivity but 
      did not affect the body weight or blood lipid profile. Cardiac systolic/diastolic 
      function, hypertrophy, and fibrosis were improved in the EVO-treated group. EVO 
      prevented cardiac lipotoxicity by reducing the accumulation of lipid droplets in 
      the myocardium through suppression of CD36, ACSL1, FABP3, PPARgamma, and DGAT1 
      and enhancement of the phosphorylation of FOXO1, indicating its inhibition. The 
      EVO-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function and reduction in damage were 
      achieved through activation of PGC1a/NRF1/TFAM, which activates mitochondrial 
      biogenesis. RNA-seq results for the whole heart confirmed that EVO treatment 
      mainly affected the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to lipid 
      metabolism. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EVO improves cardiac 
      function by reducing lipotoxicity and mitochondrial injury and provides a 
      potential therapeutic option for DCM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is insufficient evidence for the ability of vitamin K2 to 
      improve type 2 diabetes mellitus symptoms by regulating gut microbial 
      composition. Herein, we aimed to demonstrate the key role of the gut microbiota 
      in the improvement of impaired glycemic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by 
      vitamin K2 intervention. METHODS: We first performed a 6-month RCT on 60 T2DM 
      participants with or without MK-7 (a natural form of vitamin K2) intervention. In 
      addition, we conducted a transplantation of the MK-7-regulated microbiota in 
      diet-induced obesity mice for 4 weeks. 16S rRNA sequencing, fecal metabolomics, 
      and transcriptomics in both study phases were used to clarify the potential 
      mechanism. RESULTS: After MK-7 intervention, we observed notable 13.4%, 28.3%, 
      and 7.4% reductions in fasting serum glucose (P = 0.048), insulin (P = 0.005), 
      and HbA1c levels (P = 0.019) in type 2 diabetes participants and significant 
      glucose tolerance improvement in diet-induced obesity mice (P = 0.005). Moreover, 
      increased concentrations of secondary bile acids (lithocholic and 
      taurodeoxycholic acid) and short-chain fatty acids (acetic acid, butyric acid, 
      and valeric acid) were found in human and mouse feces accompanied by an increased 
      abundance of the genera that are responsible for the biosynthesis of these 
      metabolites. Finally, we found that 4 weeks of fecal microbiota transplantation 
      significantly improved glucose tolerance in diet-induced obesity mice by 
      activating colon bile acid receptors, improving host immune-inflammatory 
      responses, and increasing circulating GLP-1 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      gut-derived findings provide evidence for a regulatory role of vitamin K2 on 
      glycemic homeostasis, which may further facilitate the clinical implementation of 
      vitamin K2 intervention for diabetes management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study

AB  - BACKGROUD: Bidirectional communications between the gut microbiota and the brain 
      may play a critical role in diabetes-related cognitive impairment. Compound 
      Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP) treatment has shown remarkable improvement in 
      cognitive impairment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical 
      settings, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. PURPOSE: An extensive 
      detailed strategy via in vivo functional experiments, transcriptomics, 
      metabolomics, and network pharmacology was adopted to investigate the 
      CDDP-treatment mechanism in diabetic cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: For 12 
      weeks, KK-Ay mice, a spontaneous T2DM model, were intragastrically administered 
      various doses of CDDP solution or an equivalent volume of water, and the 
      nootropic drug piracetam was orally administered as a positive control. At the 
      12th week, cognition was assessed using Morris water maze tests and brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and 
      network pharmacology analyses were applied to reveal novel molecular mechanisms 
      of CDDP-treatment in diabetic cognitive dysfunction of KK-Ay mice, which were 
      then validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western 
      blot. RESULTS: Here we verified that CDDP can suppress inflammatory response and 
      alleviate the cognitive dysfunction in KK-Ay mice. Also, as demonstrated by 16S 
      rRNA sequencing and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis, CDDP attenuated 
      intestinal flora disorder as well as increases of metabolites including butyric 
      acid, hexanoic acid, and isohexic acid. Given the integrated analyses of network 
      pharmacology, transcriptomic, metabolomic data, and molecular biology, the 
      TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in diabetes, which could be 
      reversed by CDDP. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that CDDP restructures 
      the gut microbiota composition and increased the intestinal SCFAs in KK-Ay mice, 
      which might inhibit neuroinflammation, and thus improve diabetic mice cognitive 
      disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alternative and complementary therapies play an imperative role in 
      the clinical management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and exploring and 
      utilizing natural products from a genetic perspective may yield novel insights 
      into the mechanisms and interventions of the disorder. METHODS: To identify the 
      therapeutic target of baicalin for T2DM, we conducted a Mendelian randomization 
      study. Druggable targets of baicalin were obtained by integrating multiple 
      databases, and target-associated cis-expression quantitative trait loci 
      (cis-eQTL) originated from the eQTLGen consortium. Summary statistics for T2DM 
      were derived from two independent genome-wide association studies available 
      through the DIAGRAM Consortium (74,124 cases vs. 824,006 controls) and the 
      FinnGen R9 repository (9,978 cases vs. 12,348 controls). Network construction and 
      enrichment analysis were applied to the therapeutic targets of baicalin. 
      Colocalization analysis was utilized to assess the potential for the therapeutic 
      targets and T2DM to share causative genetic variations. Molecular docking was 
      performed to validate the potency of baicalin. Single-cell RNA sequencing was 
      employed to seek evidence of therapeutic targets' involvement in islet function. 
      RESULTS: Eight baicalin-related targets proved to be significant in the discovery 
      and validation cohorts. Genetic evidence indicated the expression of ANPEP, 
      BECN1, HNF1A, and ST6GAL1 increased the risk of T2DM, and the expression of PGF, 
      RXRA, SREBF1, and USP7 decreased the risk of T2DM. In particular, SREBF1 has 
      significant interaction properties with other therapeutic targets and is 
      supported by strong colocalization. Baicalin had favorable combination activity 
      with eight therapeutic targets. The expression patterns of the therapeutic 
      targets were characterized in cellular clusters of pancreatic tissues that 
      exhibited a pseudo-temporal dependence on islet cell formation and development. 
      CONCLUSION: This study identified eight potential targets of baicalin for 
      treating T2DM from a genetic perspective, contributing an innovative analytical 
      framework for the development of natural products. We have offered fresh insights 
      into the connections between therapeutic targets and islet cells. Further, 
      fundamental experiments and clinical research are warranted to delve deeper into 
      the molecular mechanisms of T2DM.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of epicardial adipose tissue reveals the potential 
      crosstalk genes and immune relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
      atrial fibrillation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) suggests a potential role for epicardial adipose tissue 
      (EAT) that requires further investigation. This study employs bioinformatics and 
      experimental approaches to clarify EAT's role in linking T2DM and AF, aiming to 
      unravel the biological mechanisms involved. METHOD: Bioinformatics analysis 
      initially identified common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EAT from 
      T2DM and AF datasets. Pathway enrichment and network analyses were then performed 
      to determine the biological significance and network connections of these DEGs. 
      Hub genes were identified through six CytoHubba algorithms and subsequently 
      validated biologically, with further in-depth analyses confirming their roles and 
      interactions. Experimentally, db/db mice were utilized to establish a T2DM model. 
      AF induction was executed via programmed transesophageal electrical stimulation 
      and burst pacing, focusing on comparing the incidence and duration of AF. Frozen 
      sections and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining illuminated the structures of 
      the heart and EAT. Moreover, quantitative PCR (qPCR) measured the expression of 
      hub genes. RESULTS: The study identified 106 DEGs in EAT from T2DM and AF 
      datasets, underscoring significant pathways in energy metabolism and immune 
      regulation. Three hub genes, CEBPZ, PAK1IP1, and BCCIP, emerged as pivotal in 
      this context. In db/db mice, a marked predisposition towards AF induction and 
      extended duration was observed, with HE staining verifying the presence of EAT. 
      Additionally, qPCR validated significant changes in hub genes expression in db/db 
      mice EAT. In-depth analysis identified 299 miRNAs and 33 TFs as potential 
      regulators, notably GRHL1 and MYC. GeneMANIA analysis highlighted the hub genes' 
      critical roles in stress responses and leukocyte differentiation, while immune 
      profile correlations highlighted their impact on mast cells and neutrophils, 
      emphasizing the genes' significant influence on immune regulation within the 
      context of T2DM and AF. CONCLUSION: This investigation reveals the molecular 
      links between T2DM and AF with a focus on EAT. Targeting these pathways, 
      especially EAT-related ones, may enable personalized treatments and improved 
      outcomes.

TI  - NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated premature immunosenescence drives diabetic vascular 
      aging dependent on the induction of perivascular adipose tissue dysfunction.
LID - cvae079 [pii]

AB  - AIMS: The vascular aging process accelerated by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      is responsible for the elevated risk of associated cardiovascular diseases 
      (CVDs). Metabolic disorder-induced immune senescence has been implicated in 
      multi-organ/tissue damage. Herein, we sought to determine the role of 
      immunosenescence in diabetic vascular aging and to investigate the underlying 
      mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aging hallmarks of the immune system appear 
      prior to the vasculature in streptozotocin (STZ)/high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2DM 
      mice or db/db mice. Transplantation of aged splenocytes or diabetic splenocytes 
      into young mice triggered vascular senescence and injury compared to normal 
      control splenocyte transfer. RNA-seq profile and validation in immune tissues 
      revealed that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) 
      -NLRP3 axis might be the mediator of diabetic premature immunosenescence. The 
      absence of Nlrp3 attenuated immune senescence and vascular aging during T2DM. 
      Importantly, senescent immune cells, particularly T cells, provoked perivascular 
      adipose tissue (PVAT) dysfunction and alternations in its secretome, which in 
      turn impair vascular biology. In addition, senescent immune cells may uniquely 
      affect vasoconstriction via influencing PVAT. Lastly, rapamycin alleviated 
      diabetic immune senescence and vascular aging, which may be partly due to NLRP3 
      signaling inhibition. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that NLRP3 
      inflammasome-mediated immunosenescence precedes and drives diabetic vascular 
      aging. The contribution of senescent immune cells to vascular aging is a combined 
      effect of their direct effects and induction of PVAT dysfunction, the latter of 
      which can uniquely affect vasoconstriction. We further demonstrated that 
      infiltration of senescent T cells in PVAT was increased and associated with PVAT 
      secretome alterations. Our findings suggest that blocking the NLRP3 pathway may 
      prevent early immunosenescence and thus mitigate diabetic vascular aging and 
      damage, and targeting senescent T cells or PVAT might also be the potential 
      therapeutic approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the most prevalent 
      liver disease, whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is considered an 
      independent risk factor for MAFLD incidence. Taohe Chengqi decoction (THCQ) is 
      clinically prescribed for T2DM treatment; however, the hepatoprotective effect of 
      THCQ against MAFLD is still unknown. This study intended to elucidate the 
      therapeutic effect of THCQ on T2DM-associated MAFLD and to investigate the 
      underlying mechanisms. METHODS: THCQ lyophilized powder was prepared and analyzed 
      by UHPLC-MS/MS. A stable T2DM mouse model was established by high-fat diet (HFD) 
      feeding combined with streptozotocin (STZ) injection. The T2DM mice were 
      administered THCQ (2.5 g/kg or 5 g/kg) to explore the pharmacological effects of 
      THCQ on T2DM-associated MAFLD. Liver tissue transcriptome was analyzed and the 
      participatory roles of PPARα/γ pathways were verified both in vivo and in vitro. 
      Serum metabolome analysis was used to explore the metabolome changes and skeletal 
      muscle branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic enzymes were further detected. 
      Moreover, an AAV carrying BCKDHA shRNA was intramuscularly injected to verify the 
      impact of THCQ on skeletal muscle BCAA catabolism and the potential therapeutic 
      outcome on hepatic steatosis. RESULTS: THCQ improved hepatic steatosis in MAFLD. 
      RNA-sequencing analysis showed dysregulation in the hepatic PPARγ-related fatty 
      acid synthesis, while PPARα-dependent fatty acid oxidation was elevated following 
      THCQ treatment. Interestingly, in vitro analyses of these findings showed that 
      THCQ had minor effects on fatty acid oxidation and/or synthesis. The metabolomic 
      study revealed that THCQ accelerated BCAA catabolism in the skeletal muscles, in 
      which knockdown of the BCAA catabolic enzyme BCKDHA diminished the THCQ 
      therapeutic effect on hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the 
      potential therapeutic effect of THCQ on hepatic steatosis in MALFD. THCQ 
      upregulated fatty acid oxidation and reduced its synthesis via restoration of 
      PPARα/γ pathways in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice, which is mediated through 
      augmenting BCKDH activity and accelerating BCAA catabolism in the skeletal 
      muscles. Overall, this study provided in-depth clues for "skeletal muscles-liver 
      communication" in the therapeutic effect of THCQ against hepatic steatosis. These 
      findings suggested THCQ might be a potential candidate against T2DM-associated 
      MAFLD.

TI  - Establishing genomic/transcriptomic links between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 
      diabetes mellitus by meta-analysis approach.
PG  - 501-16
AB  - Meta-analysis methods exist for combining multiple microarray datasets. However, 
      there are a wide range of issues associated with microarray meta-analysis and a 
      limited ability to compare the performance of different metaanalysis methods. 
      Using cDNA microarray technology (Partek Genomics Suite 6.6) and global pathway 
      analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (IPA, Inc), we examined the 
      transcript level in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      patients and controls. To understand the molecular link between T2DM and AD, we 
      compared the gene expression pattern and pathway involved. Microarray analysis 
      identified 235 differentially expressed genes between T2DM patients and controls; 
      and 834 between AD and controls at two fold change and a false discovery rate of 
      0.05. Significantly changed expression of "myeloid leukemia cell differentiation 
      protein 1; RAS guanyl releasing protein 1; S100 calcium-binding protein A8; 
      prostaglandin- endoperoxide synthase 2; parvalbumin; endoplasmic reticulum 
      aminopeptidase 1; phosphoglycerate kinase 1; Eukaryotic translation initiation 
      factor 3 subunit F; Interleukin-1 beta; tubulin, beta 2A; glycine receptor alpha 
      1 and ribosomal protein S24" genes were highly associated with T2DM, whereas 
      "neuronal differentiation 6; G-protein coupled receptor 83; phosphoserine 
      phosphatase; bobby sox homolog or HMG box -containing protein 2; Glutathione 
      S-transferase theta 1; alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 zinc-binding; Heat shock 70kDa 
      protein 1B; transportin 1, Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family 
      member B; Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
      3-kinase B; prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like" were found to be strongly related with 
      AD. We also found a set of differentially expressed genes; "ARP2 actin-related 
      protein 2; Cell division control protein 42; cytoplasmic polyadenylation element 
      binding protein 4; Early growth response protein 1; ectonucleotide

      metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; pyruvate dehydrogenase 
      kinase, isozyme 4; phosphoserine phosphatase, parvalbumin, and tubulin, beta 2A" 
      to be present in both dataset. Altered regulation of intracellular signaling 
      pathways, including Ephrin receptor, liver X receptor/ retinoid X receptor; 
      interleukin 6; insulinlike growth factor 1; interleukin 10 and 14-3-3-mediated 
      signaling pathways were associated with T2DM as well as Alzheimer-type pathology. 
      Our findings implicate diabetic disorders in the pathogenesis of AD, and provide 
      a basis for future candidate studies based on specific pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of mortality in 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, with its underlying mechanisms still 
      elusive. This study aims to investigate the role of cholesterol-25-monooxygenase 
      (CH25H) in T2DM induced cardiomyopathy. METHODS: High fat diet combined with 
      streptozotocin (HFD/STZ) were used to establish a T2DM model. CH25H and its 
      product 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) were detected in the hearts of T2DM model. 
      Gain- or loss-of-function of CH25H were performed by receiving AAV9-cTNT-CH25H or 
      CH25H knockout (CH25H(-/-)) mice with HFD/STZ treatment. Cardiac function was 
      evaluated using echocardiography, and cardiac tissues were collected for 
      immunoblot analysis, histological assessment and quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction (qPCR). Mitochondrial morphology and function were evaluated using 
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit. 
      RNA-sequence analysis was performed to determine the molecular changes associated 
      with CH25H deletion. RESULTS: CH25H and 25HC were significantly decreased in the 
      hearts of T2DM mice. CH25H(-/-) mice treated with HFD/STZ exhibited impaired 
      mitochondrial function and structure, increased lipid accumulation, and 
      aggregated cardiac dysfunction. Conversely, T2DM mice receiving AAV9-CH25H 
      displayed cardioprotective effects. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing and qPCR 
      analysis revealed that CH25H deficiency decreased peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and its target gene 
      expression. Additionally, administration of ZLN005, a potent PGC-1α activator, 
      partially protected against high glucose and palmitic acid induced mitochondria 
      dysfunction and lipid accumulation in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study provides 
      compelling evidence supporting the protective role of CH25H in T2DM-induced 
      cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, the regulation of PGC-1α may be intricately involved 
      in this cardioprotective process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The exact mechanisms of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain 
      largely unknown. We intended to authenticate critical genes linked to T2DM 
      progression by tandem single-cell sequencing and general transcriptome sequencing 
      data. METHODS: T2DM single-cell RNA-sequencing data were submitted by the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and ArrayExpress (EBI), from which gene 
      expression matrices were retrieved. The common cell clusters and representative 
      marker genes were ascertained by principal component analysis (PCA), 
      t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), CellMarker, and FindMarkers 
      in two datasets (GSE86469 and GSE81608). T2DM-related differentially expressed 
      marker genes were defined by intersection analysis of marker genes and 
      GSE86468-differentially expressed genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curves were utilized to assign representative marker genes with diagnostic values 
      by GSE86468, GSE29226 and external validation GSE29221, and their prospective 
      target compounds were forecasted by PubChem. Besides, the R package 
      clusterProfiler-based functional annotation was designed to unveil the intrinsic 
      mechanisms of the target genes. At last, western blot was used to validate the 
      alternation of CDKN1C and DLK1 expression in primary pancreatic islet cells 
      cultured with or without 30mM glucose. RESULTS: Three common cell clusters were 
      authenticated in two independent T2DM single-cell sequencing data, covering 
      neurons, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Functional ensemble analysis 
      disclosed an intimate association of these cell clusters with peptide/insulin 
      secretion and pancreatic development. Pseudo-temporal trajectory analysis 
      indicated that almost all epithelial and smooth muscle cells were of neuron 
      origin. We characterized CDKN1C and DLK1, which were notably upregulated in T2DM 
      samples, with satisfactory availability in recognizing three representative 
      marker genes in non-diabetic and T2DM samples, and they were also robustly 
      interlinked with the clinical characteristics of patients. Western blot also 
      demonstrated that, compared with control group, the expression of CDKN1C and DLK1 
      were increased in primary pancreatic islet cells cultured with 30 mM glucose for 
      48 h. Additionally, PubChem projected 11 and 21 potential compounds for CDKN1C 
      and DLK1, respectively. CONCLUSION: It is desirable that the emergence of the 2 
      critical genes indicated (CDKN1C and DLK1) could be catalysts for the 
      investigation of the mechanisms of T2DM progression and the exploitation of 
      innovative therapies.

AB  - Dendrobium officinale (DEN) is recognized as a kind of functional food that can 
      effectively ameliorate endocrine and metabolic disruptions. This study delved 
      into the pharmacological mechanism of DEN on hepatic lipotoxicity associated with 
      Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In vivo study experiments on db/db mice 
      indicated that DEN treatment notably enhanced liver function, decreased blood 
      lipid levels, and improved insulin sensitivity. Non-targeted metabolomics 
      analysis revealed that DEN significantly ameliorated metabolism pathways, 
      including lipoic acid, linoleic acid, bile secretion, and the 
      alanine/aspartate/glutamate metabolism, as well as taurine and hypotaurine 
      metabolism. Transcriptomics analysis demonstrated DEN treatment could modulate 
      the expression of genes such as Cpt1b, Scd1, G6pc2, Fos, Adrb2, Atp2a1, Ppp1r1b, 
      and Cyp7a1. Furthermore, Proteomics analysis indicated that the beneficial effect 
      of DEN on lipid metabolism was linked to pathways like AMPK and PPAR signaling. 
      The integrative analysis of multi-omics revealed that the PPAR-RXR signaling was 
      critical to the therapeutic effect of DEN on T2DM-induced fatty liver. 
      Additionally, in vitro study on AML-12 cells confirmed that DEN counteract 
      PA-induced lipid accumulation by activating the PPAR-RXR pathway. Overall, these 
      findings suggested that DEN exhibited the potential to mitigate T2DM-induced 
      hepatic lipo-toxicity and manage lipid imbalances in T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic 
      hyperglycaemia. Chronic metabolic abnormalities and long-term hyperglycaemia may 
      result in a wide range of acute and chronic consequences. Previous studies have 
      demonstrated that artesunate(ART) has antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, 
      antiatherosclerotic, and other beneficial effects, but the specific regulatory 
      mechanism is not completely clear. AIM: This study investigated the effects of 
      ART on metabolic disorders in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model db/db mice 
      and explored the underlying mechanisms involved. METHODS: C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice 
      were used to identify the targets and molecular mechanism of ART. Metabolomic 
      methods were used to evaluate the efficacy of ART in improving T2DM-related 
      metabolic disorders. Network pharmacology and transcriptomic sequencing were used 
      to analyse the targets and pathways of ART in T2DM. Finally, molecular biology 
      experiments were performed to verify the key targets and pathways selected by 
      network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: After a 7-week ART 
      intervention (160 mg/kg), the glucose and lipid metabolism levels of the db/db 
      mice improved. Additionally, the oxidative stress indices, namely, the MDA and 
      SOD levels, significantly improved (p<0.01). Linoleic acid and 
      glycerophospholipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and 
      purine metabolism disorders in db/db mice were partially corrected after ART 
      treatment. Network pharmacology analysis identified important targets of ART for 
      the treatment of metabolic disorders in T2DM . These targets are involved in key 
      signalling pathways, including the highest scores observed for the PI3K/Akt 
      signalling pathway. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ART could activate the 
      MAPK signalling pathway and two key gene targets, HGK and GADD45. Immunoblotting 
      revealed that ART increases p-PI3K, p-AKT, Glut2, and IRS1 protein expression and 
      suppresses the phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK, returning HGK and GADD45 
      to their preartesunate levels. CONCLUSION: Treatment of db/db mice with 160 mg/kg 
      ART for 7 weeks significantly reduced fasting blood glucose and lipid levels. It 
      also improved metabolic imbalances in amino acids, lipids, purines, and bile 
      acids, thereby improving metabolic disorders. These effects are achieved by 
      activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibiting the MAPK pathway, thus 
      demonstrating the efficacy of the drug.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was reported to be associated with impaired 
      immune response and alterations in microbial composition and function. However, 
      the underlying mechanism remains elusive. To investigate the association among 
      retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLRs) signaling pathway, 
      intestinal bacterial microbiome, microbial tryptophan metabolites, inflammation, 
      and a longer course of T2DM, 14 patients with T2DM and 7 healthy controls were 
      enrolled. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were utilized 
      to analyze the stool samples. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was carried out on the 
      peripheral blood samples. Additionally, C57BL/6J specific pathogen-free (SPF) 
      mice were used. It was found that the longer course of T2DM could lead to a 
      decrease in the abundance of probiotics in the intestinal microbiome. In 
      addition, the production of microbial tryptophan derivative skatole declined as a 
      consequence of the reduced abundance of related intestinal microbes. Furthermore, 
      low abundances of probiotics, such as Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium, could 
      trigger the inflammatory response by activating the RLRs signaling pathway. The 
      increased level of the member of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF) family, 
      nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) activator (TANK), in the animal colon activated 
      nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NFκB2), resulting in inflammatory damage. In 
      summary, it was revealed that the low abundances of probiotics could activate the 
      RLR signaling pathway, which could in turn activate its downstream signaling 
      pathway, NF-κB, highlighting a relationship among gut microbes, inflammation, and 
      a longer course of T2DM. KEY POINTS: Hyperglycemia may suppress tryptophanase 
      activity. The low abundance of Bacteroides combined with the decrease of Dopa 
      decarboxylase (DDC) activity may lead to the decrease of the production of 
      tryptophan microbial derivative skatole, and the low abundance of Bacteroides or 
      reduced skatole may further lead to the increase of blood glucose by 
      downregulating the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1). A low abundance 
      of anti-inflammatory bacteria may induce an inflammatory response by triggering 
      the RLR signaling pathway and then activating its downstream NF-κB signaling 
      pathway in prolonged T2DM.

      related to T2DM were downloaded from the DisGeNET database. Protein-protein 
      interaction network (PPI) pairs of DEGs related to peri-implantitis and T2DM 
      related genes were constructed, "hub" genes and overlapping DEG were determined. 
      Functional enrichment analysis was used to identify significant shared biological 
      processes and signaling pathways. The PPI networks were subjected to cluster and 
      specific class analysis for identifying "leader" genes. Module network analysis 
      of the merged PPI network identified common or cross-talk genes connecting the 
      two networks. RESULTS: A total of 92 DEGs overlapped between peri-implantitis and 
      T2DM datasets. Three hub genes (IL-6, NFKB1, and PIK3CG) had the highest degree 
      in PPI networks of both peri-implantitis and T2DM. Three leader genes (PSMD10, 
      SOS1, WASF3), eight cross-talk genes (PSMD10, PSMD6, EIF2S1, GSTP1, DNAJC3, 
      SEC61A1, MAPT, and NME1), and one signaling pathway (IL-17 signaling) emerged as 
      peri-implantitis and T2DM linkage mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Exploration of 
      available transcriptomic datasets revealed IL-6, NFKB1, and PIK3CG expression 
      along with the IL-17 signaling pathway as top candidate molecular linkage 
      mechanisms between peri-implantitis and T2DM.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemia and periodontitis are frequently 
      associated pathologies; however, there are no studies showing the peripheral 
      blood transcript profile of these combined diseases. Here we identified the 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of circulating lymphocytes and monocytes to 
      reveal potential biomarkers that may be used as molecular targets for future 
      diagnosis of each combination of these pathologies (compared to healthy patients) 
      and give insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of these diseases. 
      Study participants (n = 150) were divided into groups: (H) systemically and 
      periodontal healthy (control group); (P) with periodontitis, but systemically 
      healthy; (DL-P) with dyslipidemia and periodontitis; (T2DMwell-DL-P) 
      well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus with dyslipidemia and periodontitis; and 
      (T2DMpoorly-DL-P) poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus with dyslipidemia 
      and periodontitis. We preprocessed the microarray data using the Robust Multichip 
      Average (RMA) strategy, followed by the RankProd method to identify candidates 
      for DEGs. Furthermore, we performed functional enrichment analysis using 
      Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. DEGs were submitted 
      to pairwise comparisons, and selected DEGs were validated by quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction. Validated DEGs verified from T2DMpoorly-DL-P versus H 
      were: TGFB1I1, VNN1, HLADRB4 and CXCL8; T2DMwell-DL-P versus H: FN1, BPTF and 
      PDE3B; DL-P versus H: DAB2, CD47 and HLADRB4; P versus H: IGHDL-P, ITGB2 and 
      HLADRB4. In conclusion, we identified that circulating lymphocytes and monocytes 
      of individuals simultaneously affected by T2DM, dyslipidemia and periodontitis, 
      showed an altered molecular profile mainly associated to inflammatory response, 
      immune cell trafficking, and infectious disease pathways. Altogether, these 
      results shed light on novel potential targets for future diagnosis, monitoring or 
      development of targeted therapies for patients sharing these conditions.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a burdensome global disease. In-depth 
      understanding of its mechanism will help to optimize diagnosis and treatment, 
      which reduces the burden. Multi-omics research has unparalleled advantages in 
      contributing to the overall understanding of the mechanism of this chronic 
      metabolic disease. In the past two decades, the study of multi-omics on 
      T2DM-related intestinal flora perturbation and plasma dyslipidemia has shown 
      tremendous potential and is expected to achieve major breakthroughs. The 
      regulation of intestinal flora in diabetic patients has been confirmed by 
      multiple studies. The use of metagenomics, 16S RNA sequencing, and metabolomics 
      has comprehensively identified the overall changes in the intestinal flora and 
      the metabolic disturbances that could directly or indirectly participate in the 
      intestinal flora-host interactions. Lipidomics combined with other "omics" has 
      characterized lipid metabolism disorders in T2DM. The combined application and 
      cross-validation of multi-omics can screen for dysregulation in T2DM, which will 
      provide immense opportunities to understand the mechanisms behind T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the distinctive living environment, lifestyle, and diet, the 
      Tibetan community in China has the lowest prevalence of T2DM and prediabetes 
      among numerous ethnic groups, while Han community shows the highest statistic. In 
      this study, we aim to conclude the clinical manifestations of both Tibetan and 
      Han T2DM patients and their association with transcriptomic and epigenetic 
      alterations. METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 120 T2DM patients from 
      Han and Tibetan ethnic groups were conducted between 2019 to 2021 at the Hospital 
      of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The various clinical 
      features and laboratory tests were recorded and analyzed between the two groups. 
      The genome-wide methylation pattern and RNA expression were determined by Reduced 
      Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RBBS) and Poly (A) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
      from leucocytes of peripheral blood samples in 6 Han and 6 Tibetan patients. GO 
      analysis and KEGG analysis were conducted in differentially expressed genes and 
      those with differentially methylated regions. RESULTS: Compared to Han, Tibetan 
      T2DM individuals intake more coarse grains, meat and yak butter, but less refined 
      grains, vegetables and fruit. They also showed increased BMI, Hb, HbA1c, LDL, 
      ALT, GGT and eGFR, and decreased level of BUN. Among the 12 patients in the 
      exploratory cohort, we identified 5178 hypomethylated and 4787 hypermethylated 
      regions involving 1613 genes in the Tibetan group. RNA-seq showed a total of 947 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups, with 523 
      up-regulated and 424 down-regulated in Tibetan patients. By integrating DNA 
      methylation and RNA expression data, we identified 112 DEGs with differentially 
      methylated regions (overlapping genes) and 14 DEGs with promoter-related DMRs. 
      The functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the overlapping genes were 
      primarily involved in metabolic pathways, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK 
      signaling pathway, pathways in cancer and Rap1 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study demonstrates the clinical characteristics of T2DM differ subtly between 
      various ethnic groups that may be related to epigenetic modifications, thus 
      providing evidence and ideas for additional research on the genetic pattern of 
      T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common neurological 
      disorder with a high recurrence rate. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is 
      recognized as a risk factor for BPPV recurrence. However, the genomic association 
      between T2DM and BPPV recurrence remains understudied. METHODS: Differential gene 
      expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis were used to 
      identify shared genes between BPPV recurrence and T2DM. The MCC algorithm was 
      employed to select hub genes from the protein-protein interaction network of the 
      shared genes. The predictive efficacy of hub genes for BPPV recurrence and T2DM 
      was assessed using ROC curve analysis. Genemania database was used to identify 
      downstream targets of hub genes. The immune infiltration landscape of BPPV and 
      T2DM was characterized using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Correlation analysis was 
      performed to explore the relationship between hub genes and immune cells. The 
      expression levels of hub genes in patient blood samples were validated using 
      qPCR. RESULTS: Thirteen shared genes were identified and a protein-protein 
      interaction network was constructed for BPPV recurrence and T2DM. Subsequently, 
      four hub genes were selected, and their expression levels effectively predicted 
      the occurrence of BPPV recurrence and T2DM. These hub genes were highly 
      correlated with immune cell infiltration, indicating a common mechanism 
      underlying recurrent BPPV and T2DM. Finally, the upregulation of hub genes in 
      patients with T2DM comorbid with BPPV recurrence was confirmed in blood samples. 
      These hub genes may serve as predictive biomarkers for assessing the recurrence 
      rate in BPPV patients with comorbid T2DM. CONCLUSION: We proposed shared gene 
      characteristics between BPPV recurrence and T2DM, revealing an immune-mediated 
      inflammatory regulation as a common pathway and identifying four immune-related 
      biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for T2DM comorbid with recurrent 
      BPPV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Islet β cells dysfunction (IBCD) is a cortical component in 
      pathogenesis of type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM). However, the relationship of 
      ferroptosis and IBCD remains unknown. This study was aimed to screen potential 
      ferroptosis key genes to reveal latent physiological and pathological process of 
      IBCD in T2DM. METHODS: Firstly, T2DM key genes were screened by combining with 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis and WGCNA. Then, 
      ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in IBCD of T2DM were identified by taking the 
      intersection between T2DM key genes and FRGs. Finally, T2DM-FRGs were validated 
      in another T2DM dataset as well as islet single-cell RNA sequencing dataset and 
      the miRNA regulated T2DM-FRG was predicted by using four miRNA databases. 
      RESULTS: 89 T2DM key genes were identified between DEGs and WGCNA. Then, 3 
      T2DM-FRGs were screened by taking the intersection of T2DM key genes and FRGs, 
      namely ITGA6, MGST1 and ENO2. At last, MGST1 were validated as the T2DM-FRG in 
      another T2DM islet issues dataset and islet single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. 
      CONCLUSION: MGST1 may be the potential ferroptosis key gene of IBCD in T2DM.

AB  - The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to rise. 
      Therefore, it has become a major concern health issue worldwide. T2DM leads to 
      various complications, including metabolic-associated fatty liver disease 
      (MAFLD). However, comprehensive studies on MAFLD as a diabetic complication at 
      different stages are still lacking. Using advanced single-cell RNA-seq 
      technology, we explored changes of livers in two T2DM murine models. Our findings 
      revealed that increase activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) exacerbated 
      the development of MAFLD to steatohepatitis by upregulating transforming growth 
      factor β1 induced transcript 1 (Tgfb1i1). Upregulated thioredoxin-interacting 
      protein (Txnip) contributed to hepatocyte damage by impairing reactive oxygen 
      species clearance. Additionally, the capillarization of liver sinusoidal 
      endothelial cells correlated with Fabp4 overexpression in endothelial cells. A 
      novel subset of Kupffer cells (KCs) that expressed Cd36 exhibited an activated 
      phenotype, potentially participating in inflammation in the liver of diabetic 
      mice. Furthermore, ligand-receptor pair analysis indicated that activated HSCs 
      interacted with hepatocytes or KCs through Thbs2 and Lamb2 in late-stage 
      diseases. The reduction in cell-cell interactions within hepatocytes in diabetic 
      mice, reflects that the mechanisms regulating liver homeostasis is disrupted. 
      This research underscores the importance of dynamics in diabetic MAFLD, and 
      provides new insights for targeted therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus affects up to 10% of pregnancies and is 
      classified into subtypes gestational diabetes subtype A1 (GDMA1) (managed by 
      lifestyle modifications) and gestational diabetes subtype A2 (GDMA2) (requiring 
      medication). However, whether these subtypes are distinct clinical entities or 
      more reflective of an extended spectrum of normal pregnancy endocrine physiology 
      remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Integrated bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell 
      RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics harbors the potential to 
      reveal disease gene signatures in subsets of cells and tissue microenvironments. 
      We aimed to combine these high-resolution technologies with rigorous 
      classification of diabetes subtypes in pregnancy. We hypothesized that 
      differences between preexisting type 2 and gestational diabetes subtypes would be 
      associated with altered gene expression profiles in specific placental cell 
      populations. STUDY DESIGN: In a large case-cohort design, we compared validated 
      cases of GDMA1, GDMA2, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to healthy controls by 
      bulk RNA-seq (n=54). Quantitative analyses with reverse transcription and 
      quantitative PCR of presumptive genes of significant interest were undertaken in 
      an independent and nonoverlapping validation cohort of similarly 
      well-characterized cases and controls (n=122). Additional integrated analyses of 
      term placental single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data 
      enabled us to determine the cellular subpopulations and niches that aligned with 
      the GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM gene expression signatures at higher resolution and 
      with greater confidence. RESULTS: Dimensional reduction of the bulk RNA-seq data 
      revealed that the most common source of placental gene expression variation was 
      the diabetic disease subtype. Relative to controls, we found 2052 unique and 
      significantly differentially expressed genes (-2<Log(2)[fold-change]>2 
      thresholds; q<0.05 Wald Test) among GDMA1 placental specimens, 267 among GDMA2, 
      and 1520 among T2DM. Several candidate marker genes (chorionic somatomammotropin 
      hormone 1 [CSH1], period circadian regulator 1 [PER1], 
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit beta [PIK3CB], 
      forkhead box O1 [FOXO1], epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], interleukin 2 
      receptor subunit beta [IL2RB], superoxide dismutase 3 [SOD3], dedicator of 
      cytokinesis 5 [DOCK5], suppressor of glucose, and autophagy associated 1 [SOGA1]) 
      were validated in an independent and nonoverlapping validation cohort (q<0.05 
      Tukey). Functional enrichment revealed the pathways and genes most impacted for 
      each diabetes subtype, and the degree of proximal similarity to other 
      subclassifications. Surprisingly, GDMA1 and T2DM placental signatures were more 
      alike by virtue of increased expression of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic 
      regulation genes, while albumin was the top marker for GDMA2 with increased 
      expression of placental genes in the wound healing pathway. Assessment of these 
      gene signatures in single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data 
      revealed high specificity and variability by placental cell and microarchitecture 
      types. For example, at the cellular and spatial (eg, microarchitectural) levels, 
      distinguishing features were observed in extravillous trophoblasts (GDMA1) and 
      macrophages (GDMA2). Lastly, we utilized these data to train and evaluate 4 
      machine learning models to estimate our confidence in predicting the control or 
      diabetes status of placental transcriptome specimens with no available clinical 
      metadata. CONCLUSION: Consistent with the distinct association of perinatal 
      outcome risk, placentae from GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM-affected pregnancies harbor 
      unique gene signatures that can be further distinguished by altered placental 
      cellular subtypes and microarchitectural niches.

TI  - ZBED3 exacerbates hyperglycemia by promoting hepatic gluconeogenesis through CREB 
      signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated hepatic glucose production (HGP) is a prominent 
      manifestation of impaired hepatic glucose metabolism in individuals with 
      diabetes. Increased hepatic gluconeogenesis plays a pivotal role in the 
      dysregulation of hepatic glucose metabolism and contributes significantly to 
      fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes. Previous studies have identified zinc-finger 
      BED domain-containing 3 (ZBED3) as a risk gene for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and 
      its single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) is closely associated with the fasting 
      blood glucose level, suggesting a potential correlation between ZBED3 and the 
      onset of diabetes. This study primarily explores the effect of ZBED3 on hepatic 
      gluconeogenesis and analyzes the relevant signaling pathways that regulate 
      hepatic gluconeogenesis. METHODS: The expression level of ZBED3 was assessed in 
      the liver of insulin-resistant (IR)-related disease. RNA-seq and bioinformatics 
      analyses were employed to examine the ZBED3-related pathway that modulated HGP. 
      To investigate the role of ZBED3 in hepatic gluconeogenesis, the expression of 
      ZBED3 was manipulated by upregulation or silencing using adeno-associated virus 
      (AAV) in mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs) and HHL-5 cells. In vivo, 
      hepatocyte-specific ZBED3 knockout mice were generated. Moreover, AAV8 was 
      employed to achieve hepatocyte-specific overexpression and knockdown of ZBED3 in 
      C57BL/6 and db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) 
      analyses were employed to identify proteins that interacted with ZBED3. 
      Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), glutathione S-transferase (GST) - pulldown, and 
      dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to further elucidate the 
      underlying mechanism of ZBED3 in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. RESULTS: The 
      expression of ZBED3 in the liver of IR-related disease models was found to be 
      increased. Under the stimulation of glucagon, ZBED3 promoted the expression of 
      hepatic gluconeogenesis-related genes PGC1A, PCK1, G6PC, thereby increasing HGP. 
      Consistently, the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis was found to be elevated in 
      mice with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of ZBED3 and decreased in those with 
      ZBED3 knockout. Additionally, the knockdown of ZBED3 in the liver of db/db mice 
      resulted in a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis. Moreover, the study revealed 
      that ZBED3 facilitated the nuclear translocation of protein arginine 
      methyltransferases 5 (PRMT5) to influence the regulation of PRMT5-mediated 
      symmetrical dimethylation of arginine (s-DMA) of cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
      (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn affects the 
      phosphorylation of CREB and ultimately promotes HGP. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      indicates that ZBED3 promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and serves as a critical 
      regulator of the progression of diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for coronary artery 
      disease (CAD), and the complications of CAD are the leading cause of deaths among 
      people with DM. Herein, this study aims to identify the common genes and pathways 
      between diabetes and myocardial infarction (MI) to provide more clues for the 
      related mechanism studies. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
      identified using the cutoff (|log2(fold change)|>0.45 and P value<0.05) by the 
      analysis of online datasets (GSE9006 and GSE48060) related to DM and MI 
      respectively. Moreover, the overlapped DEGs between DM and MI were identified, 
      followed by enriched Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. And the independent patient RNA samples were 
      collected for qRT-PCR validation of the mRNA expression of these overlapped 
      genes. RESULTS: PI3, ACSL1, MMD and MMP were altered in both T1DM and MI, and 
      they were highly related to "regulation of cellular protein metabolic process". 
      Meanwhile, six genes were identified in both T2DM and MI, which are ADM, NFIL3, 
      PI3, SLPI, ACSL1 and MMP9 and significantly related to "negative regulation of 
      endopeptidase activity". And the expression of these genes were validated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we identified the common DEGs and pathways between T1DM 
      or T2DM and MI, and further validated the changes of those DEGs, providing some 
      clues for mechanism study and potentially therapeutic targets.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a 
      public health problem worldwide. There is growing interest in finding drugs to 
      treat T2DM from herbal medicine. Berberidis Cortex is a traditional Tibetan herb 
      commonly used in the treatment of T2DM, and alkaloids are its main active 
      components. However, the anti-diabetic mechanisms of the total alkaloids of 
      Berberidis Cortex (TBC) remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the anti-T2DM efficacy of TBC and reveal the mechanisms behind 
      its effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS technology was 
      employed to qualitatively identify alkaloid components in TBC. T2DM rat models 
      were induced by high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin, and then treated with 
      different doses of TBC (43.5, 87, 174 mg/kg/d) for 40 days. Biochemical 
      parameters, such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), oral glucose tolerance test 
      (OGTT), glycated serum protein (GSP), homeostatic model assessment of insulin 
      resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alongside H&E and PAS staining were used to 
      evaluate the anti-diabetic activity of TBC. More importantly, metagenomics, 
      transcriptomics, targeted metabolomics, and Western blot analysis were integrated 
      to reveal the underlying mechanisms of TBC for T2DM treatment. RESULTS: TBC 
      significantly reduced the levels of FBG, OGTT, GSP, HOMA-IR, TC, TG, and LDL-C, 
      and improved the histopathological alterations of pancreatic and liver tissues in 
      T2D rats. It also reduced serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and several 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α). Gut microbiome analysis by 
      metagenomics proved that TBC could improve gut microbiota dysbiosis, including an 
      increase in some beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and 
      Lactobacillus acidophilus) and a decrease in some harmful bacteria (e.g., 
      Marvinbryantia and Parabacteroides). Western blot analysis found that TBC 
      significantly up-regulated the expression of three intestinal barrier related 
      tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1), and effectively 
      suppressed several key proteins in the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB inflammatory cascade, 
      including TLR4, MyD88 and p-NF-κB p65. Moreover, hepatic transcriptomics analysis 
      further revealed the regulatory role of TBC on gluconeogenesis related genes, 
      such as Pgc, and Creb1. Targeted metabolomics and Western blot analysis showed 
      that TBC improved BAs dysregulation in T2DM rats, specifically increasing TCDCA 
      and CA levels, thereby activating several proteins in the FXR/FGF15 signaling 
      axis (i.e., FXR, FGF15 and FGFR4), and then decreased the expression of p-CREB1 
      and PGC-1α to inhibit liver gluconeogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: TBC can significantly 
      improve hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation in 
      T2DM rats. The mechanism is related to the regulation of multiple links, 
      including improving gut microbiota dysbiosis, protecting the intestinal barrier 
      by up-regulating the expression of three tight junction proteins, reducing 
      inflammation by inhibiting the LPS/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, and inhibiting liver 
      gluconeogenesis by regulating BAs/FXR/FGF15 and CREB1/PGC-1α signaling pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal dysfunction are often associated with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM), a complicated metabolic illness. Contributing factors have been 
      proposed, including genetic predisposition, gene environmental, and lifestyle 
      interactions, but the pathophysiology remains unknown. METHODS: We aim to explore 
      the possible causes behind gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by type 2 diabetes 
      in this study. A comprehensive analysis of the gastric sinus metabolome, 
      transcriptome, and proteome in db/db mice with gastrointestinal dysfunction was 
      conducted. RESULTS: The model group of mice had considerably lower small 
      intestine propulsion and gastric emptying rates, higher blood glucose levels, and 
      were significantly obese compared to the control group. We identified 297 genes, 
      350 proteins, and 1,001 metabolites exhibiting significant differences between 
      db/db and control mice (p < 0.05). Moreover, multi-omics analysis revealed that 
      the genes, proteins, and metabolites in the T2DM-induced gastroenteropathy mice 
      group were involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid 
      metabolism and vitamin digestion and absorption. Specifically, Cbr3, Etnppl, and 
      Apob were the major mRNAs associated with T2DM-induced gastrointestinal 
      dysfunction, while Cyp2b10, Cyp2b19, Pgs1, Gpat3, Apoa4, and Tcn2 were the major 
      proteins associated with T2DM-induced gastrointestinal injury, and 16(R)-HET, 
      5-HETE, LysoPC (22:0), and Pantothenic acid were the major metabolites associated 
      with T2DM-induced gastrointestinal disorders. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action 
      of diabetic gastroenteropathy may be related to vitamin digestion and absorption, 
      glycerophospholipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and 
      recent epidemiological studies suggested type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an 
      independent risk factor for the development of AF. Zinc finger and BTB 
      (broad-complex, tram-track and bric-a-brac) domain containing 16 (Zbtb16) serve 
      as transcriptional factors to regulate many biological processes. However, the 
      potential effects of Zbtb16 in AF under T2DM condition remain unclear. Here, we 
      reported that db/db mice displayed higher AF vulnerability and Zbtb16 was 
      identified as the most significantly enriched gene by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
      analysis in atrium. In addition, thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) was 
      distinguished as the key downstream gene of Zbtb16 by Cleavage Under Targets and 
      Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assay. Mechanistically, increased Txnip combined with 
      thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) in mitochondrion induced excess reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) release, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) 
      overactivation, and spontaneous Ca(2+) waves (SCWs) occurrence, which could be 
      inhibited through atrial-specific knockdown (KD) of Zbtb16 or Txnip by 
      adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) or Mito-TEMPO treatment. High glucose 
      (HG)-treated HL-1 cells were used to mimic the setting of diabetic in vitro. 
      Zbtb16-Txnip-Trx2 signaling-induced excess ROS release and CaMKII activation were 
      also verified in HL-1 cells under HG condition. Furthermore, atrial-specific 
      Zbtb16 or Txnip-KD reduced incidence and duration of AF in db/db mice. 
      Altogether, we demonstrated that interrupting Zbtb16-Txnip-Trx2 signaling in 
      atrium could decrease AF susceptibility via reducing ROS release and CaMKII 
      activation in the setting of T2DM.

TI  - Hyperglycemia Promotes Endothelial Cell Senescence through AQR/PLAU Signaling 
      Axis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23052879 [doi]
LID - 2879
AB  - Hyperglycemia is reported to accelerate endothelial cell senescence that 
      contributes to diabetic complications. The underlying mechanism, however, remains 
      elusive. We previously demonstrated AQR as a susceptibility gene for type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and showed that it was increased in multiple tissues in 
      models with T2DM or metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the role 
      of AQR in hyperglycemia-induced senescence and its underlying mechanism. Here, we 
      retrieved several datasets of the aging models and found the expression of AQR 
      was increased by high glucose and by aging across species, including C. elegans 
      (whole-body), rat (cardiac tissues), and monkey (blood). we validated the 
      increased AQR expression in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
      (HUVECs). When overexpressed, AQR promoted the endothelial cell senescence, 
      confirmed by an increased number of cells stained with senescence-associated 
      beta-galactosidase and upregulation of CDKN1A (P21) as well as the prohibited 
      cellular colony formation and G2/M phase arrest. To explore the mechanism by 
      which AQR regulated the cellular senescence, transcriptomic analyses of HUVECs 
      with the overexpression and knockdown of the AQR were performed. We identified 52 
      co-expressed genes that were enriched, in the terms of plasminogen activation, 
      innate immunity, immunity, and antiviral defense. Among co-expressed genes, PLAU 
      was selected to evaluate its contribution to senescence for its highest strength 
      in the enrichment of the biological process. We demonstrated that the knockdown 
      of PLAU rescued senescence-related phenotypes, endothelial cell activation, and 
      inflammation in models induced by AQR or TNF-α. These findings, for the first 
      time, indicate that AQR/PLAU is a critical signaling axis in the modulation of 
      endothelial cell senescence, revealing a novel link between hyperglycemia and 
      vascular dysfunction. The study may have implications in the prevention of 
      premature vascular aging associated with T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current therapeutic strategies for type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) rely on increasing or substituting endogenous insulin secretion 
      in combination with lifestyle changes. β-cell regeneration, a process whereby new 
      β-cells arise from progenitors, self-renewal or transdifferentiation, has the 
      potential to become a viable route to insulin self-sufficiency. Current 
      regeneration strategies capture many of the transcriptomic and protein features 
      of native β-cells, generating cells capable of glucose-dependent insulin 
      secretion in vitro and alleviation of hyperglycemia in vivo. However, whether 
      novel β-cells display appreciable heterogeneity remains poorly understood, with 
      potential consequences for long-term functional robustness. SCOPE OF REVIEW: The 
      review brings together crucial discoveries in the β-cell regeneration field with 
      state-of-the-art knowledge regarding β-cell heterogeneity. Aspects that might aid 
      production of longer-lasting and more plastic regenerated β-cells are highlighted 
      and discussed. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Different β-cell regeneration approaches result 
      in a similar outcome: glucose-sensitive, insulin-positive cells that mimic the 
      native β-cell phenotype but which lack normal plasticity. The β-cell 
      subpopulations identified to date expand our understanding of β-cell survival, 
      proliferation and function, signposting the direction for future regeneration 
      strategies. Therefore, regenerated β-cells should exhibit stimulus-dependent 
      differences in gene and protein expression, as well as establish a functional 
      network with different β-cells, all while coexisting with other cell types on a 
      three-dimensional platform.

TI  - Association of epilepsy, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM): a population-based cohort retrospective study, impact of AEDs on 
      T2DM-related molecular pathway, and via peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor γ transactivation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A potential association between epilepsy and subsequent type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has emerged in recent studies. However, the association 
      between epilepsy, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), and the risk of T2DM development 
      remains controversial. We aimed to conduct a nationwide, population-based, 
      retrospective, cohort study to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: We extracted 
      data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Generation Tracking Database of patients with 
      new-onset epilepsy and compared it with that of a comparison cohort of patients 
      without epilepsy. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze 
      the difference in the risk of developing T2DM between the two cohorts. 
      Next-generation RNA sequencing was used to characterize T2DM-related 
      molecularchanges induced by AEDs and the T2DM-associated pathways they alter. The 
      potential of AEDs to induce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) 
      transactivation was also evaluated. RESULTS: After adjusting for comorbidities 
      and confounding factors, the case group (N = 14,089) had a higher risk for T2DM 
      than the control group (N = 14,089) [adjusted hazards ratio (aHR), 1.27]. 
      Patients with epilepsy not treated with AEDs exhibited a significantly higher 
      risk of T2DM (aHR, 1.70) than non-epileptic controls. In those treated with AEDs, 
      the risk of developing T2DM was significantly lower than in those not treated 
      (all aHR ≤ 0.60). However, an increase in the defined daily dose of phenytoin 
      (PHE), but not of valproate (VPA), increased the risk of T2DM development (aHR, 
      2.28). Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed 
      that compared to PHE, VPA induced multiple beneficial genes associated with 
      glucose homeostasis. Among AEDs, VPA induced the specific transactivation of 
      PPARγ. DISCUSSION: Our study shows epilepsy increases the risk of T2DM 
      development, however, some AEDs such as VPA might yield a protective effect 
      against it. Thus, screening blood glucose levels in patients with epilepsy is 
      required to explore the specific role and impact of AEDs in the development of 
      T2DM. Future in depth research on the possibility to repurpose VPA for the 
      treatment of T2DM, will offer valuable insight regarding the relationship between 
      epilepsy and T2DM.

TI  - Liraglutide promotes UCP1 expression and lipolysis of adipocytes by promoting the 
      secretion of irisin from skeletal muscle cells.

AB  - Although Liraglutide (Lira) increases serum irisin levels in type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM), it is unclear whether it induces expression of uncoupling 
      protein 1 (UCP1) of adipocytes via promoting irisin secretion from skeletal 
      muscle. Male T2DM rats were treated with 0.4 mg/kg/d Lira twice a day for 8 
      weeks, and the protein expression of phosphorylated AMP kinase (p-AMPK), 
      phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (p-ACC1) and UCP1 in white adipose 
      tissues were detected. Differentiated C2C12 cells were treated with palmitic acid 
      (PA) and Lira to detect the secretion of irisin. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were 
      treated with irisin, supernatant from Lira-treated C2C12 cells, Compound C or 
      siAMPKα1, the triglyceride (TG) content and the related gene expression were 
      measured. The transcriptome in irisin-treated differentiated 3T3-L1 cells was 
      analyzed. Lira elevated serum irisin levels, decreased the adipocyte size and 
      increased the protein expression of UCP1, p-AMPK and p-ACC1 in WAT. Moreover, it 
      promoted the expression of PGC1α and FNDC5, the secretion of irisin in PA-treated 
      differentiated C2C12 cells. The irisin and supernatant decreased TG synthesis and 
      promoted the expression of browning- and lipolysis-related genes in 
      differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. While Compound C and siAMPKα1 blocked AMPK 
      activities and expression, irisin partly reversed the pathway. Finally, the 
      transcriptome analysis indicated that differently expressed genes are mainly 
      involved in browning and lipid metabolism. Overall, our findings showed that Lira 
      modulated muscle-to-adipose signaling pathways in diabetes via irisin-mediated 
      AMPKα/ACC1/UCP1/PPARα pathway. Our results suggest a new mechanism for the 
      treatment of T2DM by Lira.

TI  - Metabolomic Selection in the Progression of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Genetic 
      Algorithm Approach.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12112803 [doi]
LID - 2803
AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      is a result of the inefficient use of insulin by the body. More than 95% of 
      people with diabetes have T2DM, which is largely due to excess weight and 
      physical inactivity. This study proposes an intelligent feature selection of 
      metabolites related to different stages of diabetes, with the use of genetic 
      algorithms (GA) and the implementation of support vector machines (SVMs), 
      K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) and Nearest Centroid (NEARCENT) and with a dataset 
      obtained from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social with the protocol name of 
      the following: "Análisis metabolómico y transcriptómico diferencial en orina y 
      suero de pacientes pre diabéticos, diabéticos y con nefropatía diabética para 
      identificar potenciales biomarcadores pronósticos de daño renal" (differential 
      metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses in the urine and serum of pre-diabetic, 
      diabetic and diabetic nephropathy patients to identify potential prognostic 
      biomarkers of kidney damage). In order to analyze which machine learning (ML) 
      model is the most optimal for classifying patients with some stage of T2DM, the 
      novelty of this work is to provide a genetic algorithm approach that detects 
      significant metabolites in each stage of progression. More than 100 metabolites 
      were identified as significant between all stages; with the data analyzed, the 
      average accuracies obtained in each of the five most-accurate implementations of 
      genetic algorithms were in the range of 0.8214-0.9893 with respect to average 
      accuracy, providing a precise tool to use in detections and backing up a 
      diagnosis constructed entirely with metabolomics. By providing five potential 
      biomarkers for progression, these extremely significant metabolites are as 
      follows: "Cer(d18:1/24:1) i2", "PC(20:3-OH/P-18:1)", "Ganoderic acid C2", 
      "TG(16:0/17:1/18:1)" and "GPEtn(18:0/20:4)".

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are 
      closely related. The function of immunocytes in the pathogenesis of CAD and T2DM 
      has not been extensively studied. The quantitative bioinformatics analysis of the 
      public RNA sequencing database was applied to study the key genes that mediate 
      both CAD and T2DM. The biological characteristics of associated key genes and 
      mechanism of CD8(+) T and NK cells in CAD and T2DM are our research focus. 
      METHODS: With expression profiles of GSE66360 and GSE78721 from the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we identified core modules associated with 
      gene co-expression relationships and up-regulated genes in CAD and T2DM using 
      Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and the 'limma' software 
      package. The enriched pathways of the candidate hub genes were then explored 
      using GO, KEGG and GSEA in conjunction with the immune gene set (from the MSigDB 
      database). A diagnostic model was constructed using logistic regression analysis 
      composed of candidate hub genes in CAD and T2DM. Univariate Cox regression 
      analysis revealed hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and 
      p-values for candidate hub genes in diagnostic model, while CIBERSORT and immune 
      infiltration were used to assess the immune microenvironment. Finally, monocytes 
      from peripheral blood samples and their immune cell ratios were analyzed by flow 
      cytometry to validate our findings. RESULTS: Sixteen candidate hub genes were 
      identified as being correlated with immune infiltration. Univariate Cox 
      regression analysis revealed that NPEPPS and ABHD17A were highly correlated with 
      the diagnosis of CAD and T2DM. The results indicate that CD8(+) T cells (p = 
      0.04) and NK(bright) cells (p = 3.7e-3) are significantly higher in healthy 
      controls than in individuals with CAD or CAD combined with T2DM. The 
      bioinformatics results on immune infiltration were well validated by flow 
      cytometry. CONCLUSIONS: A series of bioinformatics studies have shown ABHD17A and 
      NPEPPS as key genes for the co-occurrence of CAD and T2DM. Our study highlights 
      the important effect of CD8(+) T and NK cells in the pathogenesis of both 
      diseases, indicating that they may serve as viable targets for diagnosis and 
      therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have suggested a positive association between 
      environmental cadmium (Cd) exposure and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Skeletal 
      muscle insulin resistance (IR) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. 
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic low-level Cd exposure on 
      skeletal muscle IR and its potential mechanism. Rats were exposed to drinking 
      water containing 2 or 10 mg/L Cd for 24 weeks. Differentiated L6 myotubes were 
      treated with Cd for 72 h. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry assay, 
      RNA-sequencing, and Seahorse analysis were conducted to determine the effects of 
      Cd and its underlying mechanism on relevant parameters, including insulin 
      sensitivity, glucose uptake, oxidative stress, mitophagy, and mitochondrial 
      function in skeletal muscle and L6 myotubes. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a scavenger 
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitophagy inhibitor Cyclosporin A (CsA) 
      were used to confirm the role of oxidative stress in mitophagy and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction caused by Cd. We found that rats exposed to 10 mg/L Cd exhibited 
      hyperglycemia and skeletal muscle IR. Cd markedly increased IRS-1 phosphorylation 
      at Ser612, while decreased levels of phosphorylated PI3K, Akt, AS160, inhibited 
      GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. Mechanistically, Cd increased the 
      intracellular ROS, hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde levels and decreased 
      antioxidase activity in L6 myotubes. Furthermore, Cd upregulated the mRNA and 
      protein levels of LC3II/I, PINK1, and Parkin. In addition, Cd induced the 
      formation of mitophagosomes, reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, 
      decreased the adenosine triphosphate content, and impaired the mitochondrial 
      respiratory capacity. Strikingly, NAC ameliorated oxidative stress, excessive 
      mitophagy, and the associated reduction in myotube insulin sensitivity, while 
      inhibition of mitophagy by CsA alleviated skeletal muscle IR. In conclusion, this 
      study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism that chronic low-level Cd 
      exposure may induce mitophagy by activating the PINK1/Parkin signal pathway by 
      increasing ROS, thus causing skeletal muscle IR and elevated blood glucose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major 21st-century epidemic. 
      T2DM elevates the risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure while also 
      reducinges survival rates. Recently Ferroptosis has been found to be involved in 
      the development of various cardiovascular diseases. TRPV1 is also a potential 
      therapeutic target for cardioprotection. This study explores whether capsaicin, a 
      transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) agonist, can prevent 
      diabetic myocardial infarction-induced injury by inhibiting ferroptosis. METHODS: 
      T2DM model was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with streptozocin 
      (STZ) injections, and the diabetic mice were treated with capsaicin(0.015 %) in 
      their food. Myocardial infarction model was established as well. Mouse' general 
      characteristics, cardiac function, and morphological histology were observed and 
      analyzed. RNA-seq was used to investigate the possible mechanism of injury in 
      AC16 cardiomyocytes cultured with high glucose and hypoxia. In addition, the 
      potential mechanism of capsaicin against injury was further investigated in AC16 
      cardiomyocytes cultured with high glucose and hypoxia. RESULTS: The RNA-seq 
      analysis revealed that ferroptosis was associated with cell death induced by 
      high-glucose in combination with hypoxia, and CAP treatment could effectively 
      inhibit ferroptosis to enhance cell survival. In vivo studies demonstrated that 
      CAP treatment significantly improved post-MI cardiac function, attenuated 
      myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, it was observed that CAP 
      reduced ferroptosis levels by activating TRPV1 in the heart, upregulating Nrf2 
      expression, promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increasing the expression of 
      the Nrf2 downstream molecule Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary 
      capsaicin may inhibit cardiomyocyte ferroptosis through activation of myocardial 
      TRPV1 and Nrf2/HMOX1 signaling pathway, which in turn exerts a protective effect 
      on the myocardium after myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic mice.

AB  - PURPOSE: According to the World Health Organization, Saudi Arabia ranks seventh 
      worldwide in the number of patients with diabetes mellitus. To our knowledge, no 
      research has addressed the potential of noncoding RNA as a diagnostic and/or 
      management biomarker for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) living in 
      high-altitude areas. This study aimed to identify molecular biomarkers 
      influencing patients with T2DM living in high-altitude areas by analyzing lncRNA 
      and mRNA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were 
      used to identify significantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in T2DM and healthy 
      control groups. Coding potential was analyzed using coding-noncoding indices, the 
      coding potential calculator, and PFAM, and the lncRNA function was predicted 
      using Pearson's correlation. Differentially expressed transcripts between the 
      groups were identified, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes enrichment analyses were performed to identify the biological functions 
      of both lncRNAs and mRNAs. RESULTS: We assembled 1766 lncRNAs in the T2DM group, 
      of which 582 were novel. This study identified three lncRNA target genes (KLF2, 
      CREBBP, and REL) and seven mRNAs (PIK3CD, PIK3R5, IL6R, TYK2, ZAP70, LAMTOR4, and 
      SSH2) significantly enriched in important pathways, playing a role in the 
      progression of T2DM. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this comprehensive 
      study is the first to explore the applicability of certain lncRNAs as diagnostic 
      or management biomarkers for T2DM in females in Taif City, Saudi Arabia through 
      the genome-wide identification of lncRNA and mRNA profiling using RNA seq and 
      bioinformatics analysis. Our findings could help in the early diagnosis of T2DM 
      and in designing effective therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common complication of Type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Understanding the pathogenesis of this complication is 
      essential in both diagnosis and management. Thus, this study aimed to 
      characterize the presence of CAD in T2DM using molecular markers and pathway 
      analyses. METHODS: The study is a sex- and age-frequency matched case-control 
      design comparing 23 unrelated adult Filipinos with T2DM-CAD to 23 controls (DM 
      with CAD). Healthy controls served as a reference. Total RNA from peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) underwent whole transcriptomic profiling using 
      the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4.0 expression beadchip. Differential gene expression 
      with gene ontogeny analyses was performed, with supporting correlational analyses 
      using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). RESULTS: The study observed 
      that 458 genes were differentially expressed between T2DM with and without CAD 
      (FDR<0.05). The 5 top genes the transcription factor 3 (TCF3), allograft 
      inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1), nuclear factor, interleukin 3 regulated (NFIL3), 
      paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha (PILRA), and 
      cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) with AUCs >89%. Pathway analyses show 
      differences in innate immunity activity, which centers on the myelocytic 
      (neutrophilic/monocytic) theme. SNP-module analyses point to a possible causal 
      dysfunction in innate immunity that triggers the CAD injury in T2DM. CONCLUSION: 
      The study findings indicate the involvement of innate immunity in the development 
      of T2DM-CAD, and potential immunity markers can reflect the occurrence of this 
      injury. Further studies can verify the mechanistic hypothesis and use of the 
      markers.

AB  - For a better understanding of diabetic angiopathy (DA), the potential biomarkers 
      in lacrimal DA and its potential mechanism, we evaluated the morphological and 
      hemodynamic alterations of lacrimal glands (LGs) in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      and healthy counterparts by color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI). We further 
      established a type 2 diabetic mice model and performed hematoxylin-eosin (HE) 
      staining, immunofluorescence staining of CD31, RNA-sequencing analysis, and 
      connectivity map (CMap) analysis. We found atrophy and ischemia in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes and mice models. Furthermore, we identified 846 differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and vehicle mice 
      by RNA-seq. The gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated significant enrichment of 
      immune system process, regulation of blood circulation, apoptotic, regulation of 
      secretion, regulation of blood vessel diameter, and so on. The molecular complex 
      detection (MCODE) showed 17 genes were involved in the most significant module, 
      and 6/17 genes were involved in vascular disorders. CytoHubba revealed the top 10 
      hub genes of DEGs, and four hub genes (App, F5, Fgg, and Gas6) related to 
      vascular regulation were identified repeatedly by MCODE and cytoHubba. GeneMANIA 
      analysis demonstrated functions of the four hub genes above and their associated 
      molecules were primarily related to the regulation of circulation and 
      coagulation. CMap analysis found several small molecular compounds to reverse the 
      altered DEGs, including disulfiram, bumetanide, genistein, and so on. Our outputs 
      could empower the novel potential targets to treat lacrimal angiopathy, diabetes 
      dry eye, and other diabetes-related diseases.

TI  - Comparatively analyzing the liver-specific transcriptomic profiles in Kunming 
      mice afflicted with streptozotocin- and natural food-induced type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptozotocin is a classic drug used to induce diabetes in animal 
      models. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the liver 
      transcriptome of Kunming mice with diabetes induced by either streptozotocin 
      (STZ) or Non-STZ. METHODS: Forty male mice were randomly assigned into four 
      groups: Control (Ctr, standard diet), mHH (high fat and high carbohydrate diet), 
      mHS (high fat and high carbohydrate diet for 4 weeks followed by 60 mg/kg STZ for 
      3 consecutive days) and mSH (60 mg/kg STZ for 3 consecutive days followed by a 
      high fat and high carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks). All mice injected with STZ 
      were identified as diabetic despite the sequential feeding of high fat and high 
      carbohydrate diets. RESULTS: Only 7 of 13 mice in the mHH group met the 
      diagnostic criteria for diabetes. The asting blood glucose (FBG) of the mHH, mHS, 
      mSH and Ctrl groups was 13.27 ± 1.14, 15.01 ± 2.59, 15.95 ± 4.38 and 
      6.28 ± 0.33 mmol/L at the 12th week, respectively. Compared with the mHH group, 
      transcription was elevated in 85 genes in the livers of mHS mice, while 21 genes 
      were downregulated and 97 genes were upregulated in the mSH group while 35 genes 
      were decreased. A total of 43 co-expressed genes were identified in the mHS vs 
      mHH and mSH vs mHH groups. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes) analyses showed that two corporate GO terms and two KEGG 
      pathways were significantly annotated in the STZ-treated groups. Both the GO term 
      and pathway were related to the metabolism mediated by p53. CONCLUSION: A high 
      fat and high carbohydrate diet combined with a low dose of STZ can effectively 
      induce diabetes in Kunming mice despite the abnormal expressions of genes in the 
      liver. The differentially expressed genes were related to metabolism mediated by 
      p53.

TI  - The role of beta cell heterogeneity in islet function and insulin release.
PG  - R43-R60
LID - 10.1530/JME-18-0011 [doi]
AB  - It is becoming increasingly apparent that not all insulin-secreting beta cells 
      are equal. Subtle differences exist at the transcriptomic and protein expression 
      levels, with repercussions for beta cell survival/proliferation, calcium 
      signalling and insulin release. Notably, beta cell heterogeneity displays 
      plasticity during development, metabolic stress and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). Thus, heterogeneity or lack thereof may be an important contributor to 
      beta cell failure during T2DM in both rodents and humans. The present review will 
      discuss the molecular and cellular features of beta cell heterogeneity at both 
      the single-cell and islet level, explore how this influences islet function and 
      insulin release and look into the alterations that may occur during obesity and 
      T2DM.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are two 
      of the most common diseases for older adults. Accumulating epidemiological 
      studies suggest that T2DM is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction in the 
      elderly. In this study, we aimed to dissect the genetic links between the two 
      diseases and identify potential genes contributing the most to the mechanistic 
      link. Methods: Two AD (GSE159699 and GSE28146) and two T2DM (GSE38642 and 
      GSE164416) datasets were used to identify the differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs). The datasets for each disease were detected using two platforms, 
      microarray and RNA-seq. Functional similarity was calculated and evaluated 
      between AD and T2DM DEGs considering semantic similarity, protein-protein 
      interaction, and biological pathways. Results: We observed that the overlapped 
      DEGs between the two diseases are not in a high proportion, but the functional 
      similarity between them is significantly high when considering Gene Ontology (GO) 
      semantic similarity and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), indicating that T2DM 
      shares some common pathways with AD development. Moreover, we constructed a PPI 
      network consisting of AD and T2DM DEGs, and found that the hub gene SLC2A2 
      (coding transmembrane carrier protein GLUT2), which connects the most DEGs in 
      both AD and T2DM, plays as a key regulator in linking T2DM and AD via glucose 
      metabolism related pathways. Conclusion: Through functional evaluation at the 
      systems biology level, we demonstrated that AD and T2DM are similar diseases 
      sharing common pathways and pathogenic genes. SLC2A2 may serve as a potential 
      marker for early warning and monitoring of AD for the T2DM patients.

TI  - Inhibition of PTEN promotes osteointegration of titanium implants in type 2 
      diabetes by enhancing anti-inflammation and osteogenic capacity of 
      adipose-derived stem cells.
PG  - 1358802
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2024.1358802 [doi]
LID - 1358802
AB  - Background: The low osteogenic differentiation potential and attenuated 
      anti-inflammatory effect of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from animals with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) limits osseointegration of the implant. However, 
      the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Methods: Western blotting and 
      qRT-PCR analyses were performed to investigate the effects of PTEN on the 
      osteogenic capacity of ADSCs of T2DM rats (TADSCs). We conducted animal 
      experiments in T2DM-Sprague Dawley (SD) rats to evaluate the osteogenic capacity 
      of modified TADSC sheets in vivo. New bone formation was assessed by micro-CT and 
      histological analyses. Results: In this study, adipose-derived stem cells of T2DM 
      rats exhibited an impaired osteogenic capacity. RNA-seq analysis showed that PTEN 
      mRNA expression was upregulated in TADSCs, which attenuated the osteogenic 
      capacity of TADSCs by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway. 
      miR-140-3p, which inhibits PTEN, was suppressed in TADSCs. Overexpression or 
      inhibition of PTEN could correspondingly reduce or enhance the osteogenic ability 
      of TADSCs by regulating the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway. TADSCs transfected 
      with PTEN siRNA resulted in higher and lower expressions of genes encoded in M2 
      macrophages (Arg1) and M1 macrophages (iNOS), respectively. In the T2DM rat 
      model, PTEN inhibition in TADSC sheets promoted macrophage polarization toward 
      the M2 phenotype, attenuated inflammation, and enhanced osseointegration around 
      implants. Conclusion: Upregulation of PTEN, which was partially due to the 
      inhibition of miR-140-3p, is important for the attenuated osteogenesis by TADSCs 
      owing to the inhibition of the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway. Inhibition of 
      PTEN significantly improves the anti-inflammatory effect and osteogenic capacity 
      of TADSCs, thus promoting peri-implant bone formation in T2DM rats. Our findings 
      offer a potential therapeutic approach for modifying stem cells derived from 
      patients with T2DM to enhance osseointegration.

AB  - Metabolic surgery could improve or even reverse type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      Single-anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) is one 
      of the most effective metabolic surgeries for T2DM. However, the molecular 
      mechanisms behind the SADI-S-induced T2DM improvement are not fully 
      understood.Here,T2DM rats received SADI-S and were sacrificed after 8 weeks; the 
      controls received sham surgery; Liver tissues were collected for transcriptomics 
      and proteomics analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 
      proteins (DEPs). Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was performed to validate the 
      accuracy of the proteomics results.SADI-S significantly improved glucose 
      metabolism in T2DM rats.A total of 120 genes/proteins(e.g., phosphoenolpyruvate 
      carboxykinase (Pck1) and pyruvate kinase (Pklr)) exhibited consistent expression 
      trends at both mRNA and protein levels. Among the upregulated genes/proteins 
      involved in glucose metabolic pathways, enrichment was observed in pathways such 
      as the pyruvate metabolic pathway, insulin signaling pathway, 
      glycolysis/gluconeogenesis biological processes, glucagon signaling pathway, and 
      AMPK signaling pathway. Downregulated genes/proteins were enriched in the 
      pyruvate metabolic pathway. The above-mentioned signaling pathways are implicated 
      in glucose metabolism, suggesting a potential mechanism for SADI-S-mediated 
      alleviation of T2DM. The PRM validation results indicated that all selected 
      proteins showed consistent trends between PRM and proteomics data. This 
      consistency suggests the reliability of the proteomics results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: According to epidemiological evidence, people with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the relationship between colorectal cancer (CRC) and serum levels of 
      IGF-1, IGF-1R, AGEs,RAGE and sRAGE in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: By 
      using RNA-Seq data of CRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, 
      we divided the patients into normal group(58 patients)and tumor group(446 
      patients), and analyzed the expression and prognostic value analysis of 
      IGF-1,IGF1R and RAGE. Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to 
      determine the predictive value of target gene on clinical outcomes in CRC 
      patients. In order to further combine CRC with diabetes research,one hundred 
      forty-eight patients hospitalized in the Second Hospital of Harbin Medical 
      University from July 2021 to July 2022 were enrolled and divided into CA and 
      control groups. There were 106 patients in the CA group, including 75 patients 
      with CRC and 31 patients with CRC+T2DM; the control group comprised 42 patients 
      with T2DM. Circulating levels of IGF-1, IGF-1R, AGEs, RAGE, and sRAGE in the 
      serum of the patients were measured using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbnent 
      Assay (ELISA) kits, and other clinical parameters were also measured during 
      hospitalization. Statistical methods used were χ² test, independent samples 
      t-test and Pearson correlation analysis were. Finally, we controlled for 
      confounding factors and used logistic multi-factor regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      Bioinformatics analysis showed that IGF-1, IGF1R and RAGE were highly expressed 
      in CRC patients, and the patients with high expression also showed significantly 
      lower overall survival rate. Through Cox regression analysis, IGF-1 can be used 
      as an independent influencing factor of CRC. In the ELISA experiment, serum AGE, 
      RAGE, IGF-1, and IGF-1R levels were higher in the CRC and CRC+T2DM groups than in 
      the T2DM group, but the serum sRAGE concentrations in these groups were lower 
      than those in the T2DM group (P < 0.05). Serum AGE, RAGE, sRAGE, IGF1, and IGF1R 
      levels were higher in the CRC+T2DM group than in the CRC group (P < 0.05). In 
      CRC+T2DM patients, serum AGEs were correlated with age (p = 0.027), and the serum 
      AGE levels in these groups were positively correlated with RAGE and IGF-1 levels 
      (p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with sRAGE and IGF-1R levels (p < 0.001). 
      After correcting for confounding factors based on logistic multiple regression 
      analysis, the effects of age, serum IGF-1 and IGF-1R on the development of CRC in 
      patients with T2DM were statistically significant (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Serum 
      IGF-1 and IGF-1R levels independently influenced the development of CRC in 
      patients with T2DM. Furthermore, IGF-1 and IGF-1R were correlated with AGEs in 
      CRC patients who also had T2DM, suggesting that AGEs may influence the 
      development of CRC in T2DM patients. These findings suggest that we may be able 
      to lower the risk of CRC in the clinic by regulating AGEs through the regulation 
      of blood glucose levels, which will affect IGF-1 and its receptors.

AB  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the most prevalent form of diabetes in the 
      USA, thus, the identification of biomarkers that could be used to predict the 
      progression from prediabetes to T2DM would be greatly beneficial. Recently, 
      circulating RNA including microRNAs (miRNAs) present in various body fluids have 
      emerged as potential biomarkers for various health conditions, including T2DM. 
      Whereas studies that examine the changes of miRNA spectra between healthy 
      controls and T2DM individuals have been reported, the goal of this study is to 
      conduct a baseline comparison of prediabetic individuals who either progress to 
      T2DM, or remain prediabetic. Using an advanced small RNA sequencing library 
      construction method that improves the detection of miRNA species, we identified 
      57 miRNAs that showed significant concentration differences between progressors 
      (progress from prediabetes to T2DM) and non-progressors. Among them, 26 have been 
      previously reported to be associated with T2DM in either body fluids or tissue 
      samples. Some of the miRNAs identified were also affected by obesity. 
      Furthermore, we identified miRNA panels that are able to discriminate progressors 
      from non-progressors. These results suggest that upon further validation these 
      miRNAs may be useful to predict the risk of conversion to T2DM from prediabetes.

AB  - Cell-free RNAs and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are valuable biomarkers in liquid 
      biopsies, but they are prone to preanalytical variabilities such as 
      nonstandardized centrifugation or ex vivo blood degradation. Herein, we report a 
      high-throughput and label-free inertial microfluidic device (ExoArc) for 
      isolation of platelet-free plasma from blood for RNA and EV analysis. Unlike 
      conventional inertial microfluidic devices widely used for cell sorting, a 
      submicrometer size cutoff (500 nm) was achieved which completely removed all 
      leukocytes, RBCs, platelets, and cellular debris based on differential lateral 
      migration induced by Dean vortices. The single-step operation also reduced 
      platelet-associated miRNAs (∼2-fold) compared to centrifugation. We clinically 
      validated ExoArc for plasma miRNA profiling (39 samples) and identified a 7-miRNA 
      panel that detects non-small cell lung cancer with ∼90% sensitivity. ExoArc was 
      also coupled with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to isolate EVs within 50 
      min with ∼10-fold higher yield than ultracentrifugation. As a proof-of-concept 
      for EV-based transcriptomics analysis, we performed miRNA analysis in healthy and 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects (n = 3 per group) by coupling ExoArc and 
      ExoArc+SEC with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. Among 293 
      miRNAs detected, plasmas and EVs showed distinct differentially expressed miRNAs 
      in T2DM subjects. We further demonstrated automated in-line EV sorting from low 
      volume culture media for continuous EV monitoring. Overall, the developed ExoArc 
      offers a convenient centrifugation-free workflow to automate plasma and EV 
      isolation for point-of-care diagnostics and quality control in EV manufacturing.

AB  - Stroke is the second leading cause of global mortality and continued efforts aim 
      to identify predictive, diagnostic, or prognostic biomarkers to reduce the 
      disease burden. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential 
      biomarkers in stroke. We performed comprehensive circulating miRNA profiling of 
      ischemic stroke patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), an 
      important risk factor associated with worse clinical outcomes in stroke. Serum 
      samples were collected within 24 h of acute stroke diagnosis and circulating 
      miRNAs profiled using RNA-Seq were compared between stroke patients with T2DM 
      (SWDM; n = 92) and those without T2DM (SWoDM; n = 98). Our analysis workflow 
      involved random allocation of study cohorts into discovery (n = 96) and 
      validation (n = 94) datasets. Five miRNAs were found to be differentially 
      regulated in SWDM compared to SWoDM patients. Hsa-miR-361-3p and -664a-5p were 
      downregulated, whereas miR-423-3p, -140-5p, and -17-3p were upregulated. We also 
      explored the gene targets of these miRNAs and investigated the downstream 
      pathways associated with them to decipher the potential pathways impacted in 
      stroke with diabetes as comorbidity. Overall, our novel findings provide 
      important insights into the differentially regulated miRNAs, their associated 
      pathways and potential utilization for clinical benefits in ischemic stroke 
      patients with diabetes.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) clinically exhibits a higher incidence of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC), contributing to a lousy prognosis in patients harboring both 
      diseases. Microflora-based therapy draws attention with low side effects. 
      Accumulating evidence shows that Lactobacillus brevis can improve blood glucose 
      and body weight of the T2DM mice model and reduce several cancer incidences. 
      However, the therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus brevis in affecting the 
      prognosis of T2DM+HCC remains unknown. In this study, we aim to explore this 
      question via an established T2DM+HCC mice model. We observed a significant 
      alleviation after the probiotic intervention. Lactobacillus brevis improves blood 
      glucose and insulin resistance and ameliorates Mechanically. Combined with a 
      multi-omics approach including 16SrDNA, GC-MS, and RNA-seq, we identified 
      distinct intestinal microflora composition and metabolites after Lactobacillus 
      brevis intervention. Furthermore, we found that Lactobacillus brevis delayed 
      disease progression by regulating MMP9 and NOTCH 1 signaling pathways, 
      potentially through gut microflora and BA interaction. This study indicates that 
      Lactobacillus brevis may improve the prognosis of T2DM + HCC, providing novel 
      therapeutic opportunities via targeting intestinal flora for patients with 
      T2DM+HCC.

TI  - Multi-Omics Analysis Revealed the rSNPs Potentially Involved in T2DM Pathogenic 
      Mechanism and Metformin Response.

AB  - The goal of our study was to identify and assess the functionally significant 
      SNPs with potentially important roles in the development of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) and/or their effect on individual response to antihyperglycemic 
      medication with metformin. We applied a bioinformatics approach to identify the 
      regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) associated with allele-asymmetric binding and expression 
      events in our paired ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data for peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) of nine healthy individuals. The rSNP outcomes were analyzed using 
      public data from the GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) and Genotype-Tissue 
      Expression (GTEx). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy and 
      T2DM individuals (GSE221521), including metformin responders and non-responders 
      (GSE153315), were searched for in GEO RNA-seq data. The DEGs harboring rSNPs were 
      analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      (KEGG). We identified 14,796 rSNPs in the promoters of 5132 genes of human PBMCs. 
      We found 4280 rSNPs to associate with both phenotypic traits (GWAS) and 
      expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from GTEx. Between T2DM patients and 
      controls, 3810 rSNPs were detected in the promoters of 1284 DEGs. Based on the 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we identified 31 upregulated hub 
      genes, including the genes involved in inflammation, obesity, and insulin 
      resistance. The top-ranked 10 enriched KEGG pathways for these hubs included 
      insulin, AMPK, and FoxO signaling pathways. Between metformin responders and 
      non-responders, 367 rSNPs were found in the promoters of 131 DEGs. Genes encoding 
      transcription factors and transcription regulators were the most widely 
      represented group and many were shown to be involved in the T2DM pathogenesis. We 
      have formed a list of human rSNPs that add functional interpretation to the 
      T2DM-association signals identified in GWAS. The results suggest candidate causal 
      regulatory variants for T2DM, with strong enrichment in the pathways related to 
      glucose metabolism, inflammation, and the effects of metformin.

AB  - The hypoglycemic effects of low-molecular-weight Laminaria japonica 
      polysaccharide (LJO) were investigated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice, 
      focusing on its effect on the microbiome, metabolome, and transcriptome. The 
      findings demonstrated that LJO significantly reduced fasting blood glucose 
      levels, insulin levels, and inflammatory factors. Additionally, LJO induced 
      changes in gut microbiota composition and increased the concentrations of cecal 
      short-chain fatty acids. Analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data 
      revealed that LJO primarily altered the endocrine and digestive systems, signal 
      transduction, and lipid metabolism. It led to a decrease in palmitic acid levels 
      and an increase in glutathione levels. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction assay suggested that LJO upregulated Irs1 expression, consequently 
      reducing insulin resistance. These findings strongly suggest that LJO holds 
      promise in ameliorating T2DM and may serve as a potential dietary supplement for 
      patients with T2DM.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Luteolin is a plant-derived flavonoid that exhibits a broad range 
      of pharmacological activities. Studies on luteolin have mainly focused on its use 
      for hyperlipidaemia prevention, whereas the capacity of the flavonoid to hinder 
      hyperglycaemia development remains underexplored. OBJECTIVES: To probe the 
      anti-hyperglycemic mechanism of 6,8-guanidyl luteolin quinone-chromium 
      coordination (GLQ.Cr), and to assess its regulatory effect on intestinal 
      microbiota in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. METHODS: 
      High-sucrose/high-fat diet-induced and intraperitoneal injection of 
      streptozotocin was used to develop a T2DM model. Glycometabolism related 
      indicators, histopathology, and gut microbiota composition in caecum samples were 
      evaluated, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of liver samples was conducted. Faecal 
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) was further used to verify the 
      anti-hyperglycemic activity of intestinal microbiota. RESULTS: The administration 
      of GLQ.Cr alleviated hyperglycaemia symptoms by improving liver and pancreatic 
      functions and modulating gut microbe communities (Lactobacillus, Alistipes, 
      Parabacteroides, Lachnoclostridium, and Desulfovibrio). RNA-seq analysis showed 
      that GLQ.Cr mainly affected the peroxisome proliferative activated receptor 
      (PPAR) signalling pathway in order to regulate abnormal glucose metabolism. FMT 
      significantly modulated the abundance of Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella, 
      Alistipes, Bacteroides, Ruminiclostridium, Brevundimonas and Pseudomonas in the 
      caecum to balance blood glucose levels and counteract T2DM mice inflammation. 
      CONCLUSION: GLQ.Cr improved the abnormal glucose metabolism in T2DM mice by 
      regulating the PPAR signalling pathway and modulating intestinal microbial 
      composition. FMT can improve the intestinal microecology of the recipient and in 
      turn ameliorate the symptoms of T2DM-induced hyperglycaemia.

TI  - Eicosapentaenoic acid activates the P62/KEAP1/NRF2 pathway for the prevention of 
      diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction.
PG  - 5251-5271
LID - 10.1039/d4fo00774c [doi]
AB  - Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is a severe complication of 
      diabetes mellitus (DM), threatening the life quality of the diabetic population. 
      However, there is still a lack of effective approaches for its intervention. 
      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that was not 
      previously investigated for its effect on DCD. In this study, EPA was found to 
      improve DCD in a mouse model of type 2 DM (T2DM) induced by streptozotocin and a 
      high-fat diet, exhibiting profound protective effects on cognitive dysfunction, 
      neuronal loss, and cerebral oxidative stress and inflammation. While EPA did not 
      attenuate advanced glycation end product-induced neuron injury, we hypothesized 
      that EPA might protect neurons by regulating microglia polarization, the effect 
      of which was confirmed by the co-culture of neurons and 
      lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia. RNA sequencing identified nuclear 
      factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) antioxidant signaling as a major 
      target of EPA in microglia. Mechanistically, EPA increased sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1 
      or P62) levels that might structurally inhibit Kelch-like ECH associated protein 
      1 (KEAP1), leading to nuclear translocation of NRF2. P62 and NRF2 predominantly 
      mediated EPA's effect since the knockdown of P62 or NRF2 abolished EPA's 
      protective effect on microglial oxidative stress and inflammation and sequential 
      neuron injuries. Moreover, the regulation of P62/KEPA1/NRF2 axes by EPA was 
      confirmed in the hippocampi of diabetic mice. The present work presents EPA as an 
      effective nutritional approach and microglial P62/KEAP1/NRF2 as molecular targets 
      for the intervention of DCD.

TI  - Lysophosphatidylcholine trigger myocardial injury in diabetic cardiomyopathy via 
      the TLR4/ZNF480/AP-1/NF-kB pathway.
PG  - e33601

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC), a frequent complication of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is mainly associated with severe adverse outcomes. 
      Previous research has highlighted the role of Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in 
      inducing myocardial injury; however, the specific mechanisms through which LPC 
      mediate such injury in DC remain elusive. The existing knowledge gap underscores 
      the need for additional clarification. Consequently, this study aimed to explore 
      the impact and underlying mechanisms of LPC on myocardial injury in DC. METHODS: 
      A total of 55 patients diagnosed with T2DM and 62 healthy controls were involved. 
      A combination of 16s rRNA sequencing, metabolomic analysis, transcriptomic 
      RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on fecal 
      and peripheral blood samples collected from the participants. Following this, 
      correlation analysis was carried out, and the results were further validated 
      through the mouse model of T2DM. RESULTS: Four LPC variants distinguishing T2DM 
      patients from healthy controls were identified, all of which were upregulated in 
      T2DM patients. Specifically, Lysopc (16:0, 2 N isoform) and LPC (16:0) exhibited 
      a positive correlation with nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NFKB2) and a 
      negative correlation with Zinc finger protein 480 (ZNF480) Furthermore, the 
      expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), c-Jun, c-Fos, and NFKB2 were 
      upregulated in the peripheral blood of T2DM patients and in the myocardial tissue 
      of T2DM mice, whereas ZNF480 expression level was downregulated. Lastly, 
      myocardial injury was identified in T2DM mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated 
      that LPC could induce myocardial injury in DC through the TLR4/ZNF480/AP-1/NF-kB 
      pathway, providing a precise target for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of 
      DC.

TI  - Phlorizin ameliorates cognitive and behavioral impairments via the 
      microbiota-gut-brain axis in high-fat and high-fructose diet-induced obese male 
      mice.

AB  - The long-term high-fat, high-sugar diet exacerbates type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM)-related cognitive impairments. Phlorizin, a well-studied natural compound 
      found in apples and other plants, is recognized for its bioactive properties, 
      including modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Despite its established 
      role in mitigating metabolic disorders, the neuroprotective effects of phlorizin, 
      particularly against diabetes-related cognitive dysfunction, have not been fully 
      elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of 
      dietary supplementation of phlorizin on high-fat and high-fructose diet 
      (HFFD)-induced cognitive dysfunction and evaluate the crucial role of the 
      microbiota-gut-brain axis. We found that dietary supplementation of phlorizin for 
      14 weeks effectively prevented glucolipid metabolism disorder, spatial learning 
      impairment, and memory impairment in HFFD mice. In addition, phlorizin improved 
      the HFFD-induced decrease in synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and 
      excessive activation of microglia in the hippocampus. Transcriptomics analysis 
      shows that the protective effect of phlorizin on cognitive impairment was 
      associated with increased expression of neurotransmitters and synapse-related 
      genes in the hippocampus. Phlorizin treatment alleviated colon microbiota 
      disturbance, mainly manifested by an increase in gut microbiota diversity and the 
      abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. The level of 
      microbial metabolites, including SCFA, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), and D 
      (-)-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) were also significantly increased after 
      phlorizin treatment. Integrating multiomics analysis observed tight connections 
      between phlorizin-regulated genes, microbiota, and metabolites. Furthermore, 
      removal of the gut microbiota via antibiotics treatment diminished the protective 
      effect of phlorizin against HFFD-induced cognitive impairment, underscoring the 
      critical role of the gut microbiota in mediating cognitive behavior. Importantly, 
      supplementation with SCFA and BHB alone mimicked the regulatory effects of 
      phlorizin on cognitive function. Therefore, phlorizin shows promise as a 
      potential nutritional therapy for addressing cognitive impairment associated with 
      metabolic disorders. Further research is needed to explore its effectiveness in 
      preventing and alleviating neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - PM(2.5) can cause adverse health effects via several pathways, such as inducing 
      pulmonary and systemic inflammation, penetration into circulation, and activation 
      of the autonomic nervous system. In particular, the impact of PM(2.5) exposure on 
      the liver, which plays an important role in metabolism and detoxification to 
      maintain internal environment homeostasis, is getting more attention in recent 
      years. In the present study, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned and treated 
      with PM(2.5) suspension and PBS solution for 8 weeks. Then, hepatic tissue was 
      prepared and identified by metabolomics analysis and transcriptomics analysis. 
      PM(2.5) exposure can cause extensive metabolic disturbances, particularly in 
      lipid and amino acids metabolic dysregulation.128 differential expression 
      metabolites (DEMs) and 502 differently expressed genes (DEGs) between the PM(2.5) 
      exposure group and control group were detected. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
      and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that DEGs were significantly 
      enriched in two disease pathways, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 
      type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and three signaling pathways, which are 
      TGF-beta signaling, AMPK signaling, and mTOR signaling. Besides, further 
      detection of acylcarnitine levels revealed accumulation in liver tissue, which 
      caused restricted lipid consumption. Furthermore, lipid droplet accumulation in 
      the liver was confirmed by Oil Red O staining, suggesting hepatic steatosis. 
      Moreover, the aberrant expression of three key transcription factors revealed the 
      potential regulatory effects in lipid metabolic disorders, the peroxisomal 
      proliferative agent-activated receptors (PPARs) including PPARα and PPARγ is 
      inhibited, and the activated sterol regulator-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) is 
      overexpressed. Our results provide a novel molecular and genetic basis for a 
      better understanding of the mechanisms of PM(2.5) exposure-induced hepatic 
      metabolic diseases, especially in lipid metabolism.

      chronic exposure to a mixture of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants in 
      zebrafish.

AB  - Mixtures of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants (C-POPs-Mix) are chemically 
      related risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, the effects of 
      chronic exposure to C-POPs-Mix on microbial dysbiosis remain poorly understood. 
      Herein, male and female zebrafish were exposed to C-POPs-Mix at a 1:1 ratio of 
      five organochlorine pesticides and Aroclor 1254 at concentrations of 0.02, 0.1, 
      and 0.5 μg/L for 12 weeks. We measured T2DM indicators in blood and profiled 
      microbial abundance and richness in the gut as well as transcriptomic and 
      metabolomic alterations in the liver. Exposure to C-POPs-Mix significantly 
      increased blood glucose levels while decreasing the abundance and alpha diversity 
      of microbial communities only in females at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.1 μg/L. 
      The majorly identified microbial contributors to microbial dysbiosis were Bosea 
      minatitlanensis, Rhizobium tibeticum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, 
      Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Collinsella aerofaciens. PICRUSt results 
      suggested that altered pathways were associated with glucose and lipid production 
      and inflammation, which are linked to changes in the transcriptome and metabolome 
      of the zebrafish liver. Metagenomics outcomes revealed close relationships 
      between intestinal and liver disruptions to T2DM-related molecular pathways. 
      Thus, microbial dysbiosis in T2DM-triggered zebrafish occurred as a result of 
      chronic exposure to C-POPs-Mix, indicating strong host-microbiome interactions.

AB  - This review examines the complexities of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), 
      focusing on the critical role of integrating omics technologies with traditional 
      experimental methods. It underscores the advancements in understanding the 
      genetic diversity of T2DM and emphasizes the evolution towards personalized 
      treatment modalities. The paper analyzes a variety of omics approaches, including 
      genomics, methylation, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and intestinal 
      microbiomics, delineating their substantial contributions to deciphering the 
      multifaceted mechanisms underlying T2DM. Furthermore, the review highlights the 
      indispensable role of non-omics experimental techniques in comprehending and 
      managing T2DM, advocating for their integration in the development of tailored 
      medicine and precision treatment strategies. By identifying existing research 
      gaps and suggesting future research trajectories, the review underscores the 
      necessity for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. This approach 
      synergistically combines clinical insights with cutting-edge biotechnologies, 
      aiming to refine the management and therapeutic interventions of T2DM, and 
      ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. This synthesis of knowledge and 
      methodologies paves the way for innovative advancements in T2DM research, 
      fostering a deeper understanding and more effective treatment of this complex 
      condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diosmetin (Dios), a flavonoid compound with multiple 
      pharmacological activities. However, fewer studies have reported its effects on 
      type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM). Here, we address the effect of Dios on glucose 
      metabolism and gut microbiota in KK-Ay diabetic mice. METHOD: Wild type C57BL/6 J 
      mice or diabetic KK-Ay mice were treated with vehicle or Dios for one month. The 
      ELISA kit and fluorescence microscope system were respectively employed to the 
      evaluation of serum biochemical indicators and histopathological changes. Liver 
      RNA-Seq and western blot were used to reveal the key signaling pathway. The 
      effects of Dios on gut microbiota was investigated by the 16S rRNA gene 
      sequencing, as well as the relationship between Dios and C. glu on glucose 
      metabolism was explored with the C. glu transplantation. RESULTS: Dios treatment 
      significantly decreased blood glucose and increased serum insulin concentrations. 
      RNA-Seq analysis found that the underlying action mechanism of Dios on T2DM was 
      via modulating glucose metabolism, which was proved by up-regulating IRS/PI3K/AKT 
      signaling pathway to promote glycogen synthesis and GLUT4 translocation. Besides, 
      Dios treatment reshaped the unbalanced gut microbiota by suppressing the ratio of 
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and markedly increasing the richness of C. glu. 
      Moreover, treatment with C. glu and Dios together could markedly ameliorate 
      glucose metabolism by up-regulating IRS/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote 
      glycogen synthesis and GLUT4 translocation. CONCLUSIONS: Dios treatment 
      remarkably ameliorated glucose metabolism in KK-Ay diabetic mice by the 
      regulation of C. glu via IRS/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and reshaped the 
      unbalanced gut microbiota. Our study provided evidence for the application of 
      Dios to the treatment of T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder 
      characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, posing a significant global 
      health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Insulin resistance (IR) plays a 
      major role in the development of T2DM and is often linked to factors such as 
      obesity, physical inactivity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Recently, there has been 
      growing interest in exploring the potential of natural products for improving 
      insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Among these, Cynomorium songaricum 
      Rupr., an edible parasitic plant, has shown promising antidiabetic effects. 
      However, research on its beneficial effects on IR is still nascent. Therefore, 
      this study aims to investigate the application of a Cynomorium songaricum 
      flavonoid-enriched fraction (CSF) in the treatment of IR in T2DM, along with 
      elucidating the chemical and biochemical mechanisms involved. METHOD: First, 
      UHPLC/ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS was utilized to perform a chemical profiling of CSF. 
      Subsequently, glycogen synthesis, gluconeogenesis and glucose consumption assays 
      were conducted on HepG2 cells with a high glucose high insulin-induced IR model 
      to illustrate the favorable impacts of CSF on IR. Then, an innovative network 
      pharmacology analysis was executed to predict the potential chemical components 
      and hub genes contributing to CSF's protective effect against IR. To further 
      elucidate molecular interactions, molecular docking studies were performed, 
      focusing on the binding interactions between active constituents of CSF and 
      crucial targets. Additionally, an RNA-sequencing assay was employed to uncover 
      the underlying biochemical signaling pathway responsible for CSF's beneficial 
      effects. To validate these findings, western blot and qPCR assays were employed 
      to verify the pathways related to IR and the potential signaling cascades leading 
      to the amelioration of IR. RESULTS: The UHPLC/ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS analysis 
      successfully identified a total of thirty-six flavonoids derived from CSF. 
      Moreover, CSF was shown to significantly improve glycogen synthesis and glucose 
      consumption as well as inhibit gluconeogenesis in HepG2 cells of IR. An 
      innovative network pharmacology analysis unveiled key hub genes-AKT1 and 
      PI3K-integral to metabolic syndrome-related signaling pathways, which contributed 
      to the favorable impact of CSF against IR. Noteworthy active ingredients 
      including quercetin, ellagic acid and naringenin were identified as potential 
      contributors to these effects. The results of western blot and qPCR assays 
      provided compelling evidence that CSF improved insulin sensitivity by modulating 
      the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Subsequent RNA-sequencing analysis, in tandem 
      with western blot assays, delved deeper into the potential mechanisms underlying 
      CSF's advantageous effects against IR, potentially associated with the 
      enhancement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis. CONCLUSION: CSF exhibited 
      a remarkable ability to enhance insulin sensitivity in the IR model of HepG2 
      cells. This was evident through enhancements in glycogen synthesis and glucose 
      consumption, along with its inhibitory impact on gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, 
      CSF demonstrated an improvement in the insulin-mediated PI3K-Akt signaling 
      pathway. The potential active constituents were identified as quercetin, ellagic 
      acid and naringenin. The underlying biochemical mechanisms responsible for CSF's 
      beneficial effects against IR were closely linked to its capacity to mitigate ER 
      stress, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of its protective action.

AB  - Background: Yuquan Pill (YQW) is a modern concentrated pill preparation of six 
      herbs, namely, Ge Gen (Pueraria lobata Ohwi), Di huang (Rehmannia glutinosa 
      Libosch.), Tian Huafen (Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim.), Mai Dong (Ophiopogon 
      japonicus (L. f.) Ker Gawl.), Wu Weizi (Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill.) and 
      Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.). It is extensively used to treat type 2 
      diabetes-related glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. But what's the 
      pharmacodynamic substance and how it works in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) are still unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to 
      determine the likely pharmacological components and molecular mechanism of YQW's 
      intervention on T2DM by combining serum pharmacochemistry, network analysis and 
      transcriptomics. Methods: The efficacy and prototypical components of blood entry 
      were determined after oral administration of YQW aqueous solution to T2DM rats 
      induced by high-fat feed and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ), and the key targets 
      and pathways for these compounds to intervene in T2DM rats were predicted and 
      integrated using network analysis and transcriptomics techniques. Results: In 
      diabetic rats, YQW can lower TG, CHO, NO, and MDA levels (p < 0.05) while 
      increasing HDL-C levels (p < 0.01), and protecting the liver and kidney. 22 
      prototype components (including puerarin, daidzein, 3'-methoxypuerarin, and 
      liquiritigenin, among others) were found in the serum of rats after oral 
      administration of YQW for 90 min, which might be used as a possible important 
      ingredient for YQW to intervene in T2DM rats. 538 YQW pharmacodynamic 
      components-related targets and 1,667 disease-related targets were projected 
      through the PharmMapper database, with 217 common targets between the two, all of 
      which were engaged in regulating PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Ras and FoxO signal pathway. 
      Finally, the mRNA expression profiles of liver tissues from rats in the control, 
      model, and YQW groups were investigated using high-throughput mRNA sequencing 
      technology. YQW can regulate the abnormal expression of 89 differential genes in 
      a disease state, including 28 genes with abnormally high expression and 61 genes 
      with abnormally low expression. Five common genes (Kit, Ppard, Ppara, Fabp4, and 
      Tymp) and two extensively used regulatory pathways (PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling 
      pathways) were revealed by the integrated transcriptomics and network analysis 
      study. Conclusion: The mechanism of YQW's intervention in T2DM rats could be 
      linked to 22 important components like puerarin, daidzein, and glycyrrhetinic 
      acid further activating PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways by regulating key 
      targets Kit, Ppard, Ppara, Fabp4, and Tymp, and thus improving lipid metabolism 
      disorder, oxidative stress, and inflammation levels in T2DM rats. On the topic, 
      more research into the pharmacological ingredient foundation and mechanism of YQW 
      intervention in T2DM rats can be done.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder with cerebrovascular and 
      cardiovascular sequelae. Yet, a clear pattern of gene dysregulation by T2DM in 
      dementia has yet to be defined. We used single nuclei RNA sequencing technology 
      to profile the transcriptome of endothelial cells (EC) from anatomically defined 
      hippocampus of db/db mice to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes, gene 
      pathways and networks, predicted regulating transcription factors, and targets of 
      DE long noncoding RNAs. We also applied gadolinium (Gd) enhanced magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) to assess blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and 
      functionally assessed cognitive behavior. The murine gene expression profiles 
      were then integrated with those of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      vascular dementia (VaD). We reveal that the transcriptome of the diabetic 
      hippocampal murine brain endothelium differs substantially from control wild 
      types with molecular changes characterized by differential RNA coding and 
      noncoding pathways enriched for EC signaling and for endothelial functions for 
      neuroinflammation, endothelial barrier disruption, and neurodegeneration. Gd 
      enhanced structural brain MRI linked endothelial molecular alterations to BBB 
      dysfunction by neuroimaging. Integrated multiomics of hippocampal endothelial 
      gene dysregulation associated with impairments in cognitive adaptive capacity. In 
      addition, the diabetic transcriptome significantly and positively correlated with 
      that of persons with AD and VaD. Taken together, our results from comprehensive, 
      multilevel, integrated, single nuclei transcriptomics support the hypothesis of 
      T2DM-mediated neuroinflammation and endothelial cell and barrier disruption as 
      key mechanisms in cognitive decline in T2DM, thereby suggesting potential 
      endothelial-specific molecular therapeutic targets.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has shown good effects in improving 
      obesity and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the underlying mechanisms 
      remain unclear. This study explored the changes of related lncRNAs, mRNAs, and 
      signaling pathways in white adipose tissue of T2DM rats after RYGB based on 
      RNA-Seq sequencing, with the aim to provide a theoretical basis for RYGB 
      treatment. METHODS: T2DM rat models were established by continuous feeding with a 
      high-fat diet and injection of streptozotocin (STZ), after which they underwent 
      RYGB or sham surgery. After the surgery, their body weight was measured weekly. 
      Their fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting serum insulin (FSI) were also 
      measured. A homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 
      calculated at weeks 0, 8, and 12. Besides, white adipose tissue of T2DM rats was 
      collected for RNA-Seq sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR. A series of 
      bioinformatics analyses, such as differential expression genes (DEGs) screening, 
      was performed. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network construction were conducted based on the sequencing 
      data. RESULTS: RYGB surgery could significantly inhibit the weight growth rate 
      and decrease the FBG, FSI, and HOMA-IR of T2DM rats. Bioinformatics analysis of 
      RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) results revealed that 87 DE- lncRNAs (49 upregulated and 
      38 downregulated) and 1,824 DEGs (896 upregulated and 928 downregulated) were 
      present in between the RYGB group and Sham group. GO and KEGG analysis showed 
      that the target genes of DEGs and differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) 
      were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, channel 
      activity, and other processes. In addition, the PPI network diagram also 
      displayed that genes such as Fasn, Grin3a, and Nog could be key genes playing a 
      role after RYGB. qRT-PCR showed that the expression level of Grin3a in the RYGB 
      group was significantly increased compared with the Sham group, while the 
      expression of Fasn and Nog was significantly decreased, which was consistent with 
      the sequencing results. CONCLUSION: Using RNA-Seq sequencing, this study revealed 
      the changes of related lncRNAs, mRNAs, and signaling pathways in the white 
      adipose tissue of T2DM rats after RYGB and identified Fasn, Grin3a, and Nog as 
      potential key genes to function after RYGB.

AB  - Autophagy is active during cellular remodeling including muscle differentiation. 
      Muscle differentiation is dysregulated in type 2 diabetes and we therefore 
      hypothesize that muscle precursor cells from people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 
      have a dysregulation of their autophagy leading to impaired myogenesis. Muscle 
      precursor cells were isolated from people with T2DM or healthy controls and 
      differentiated in vitro. Autophagy marker levels were assessed by immunoblotting. 
      Differentially expressed autophagy-related genes between healthy and T2DM groups 
      were identified based on a previously published RNA-sequencing data-set, which we 
      verified by RT-qPCR. siRNA was used to assess the function of differentially 
      expressed autophagy genes. Basal autophagy increases during human muscle 
      differentiation, while T2DM muscle cells have reduced levels of autophagy marker 
      ATG7 and show a blunted response to starvation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the 
      3 non-canonical autophagy genes DRAM1, VAMP8 and TP53INP1 as differentially 
      expressed between healthy and T2DM groups during myoblast differentiation, and 
      that T53INP1 knock-down alters expression of both pro-and anti-apoptotic genes. 
      In vitro differentiated T2DM muscle cells show differential expression of 
      autophagy-related genes. These genes do not regulate myogenic transcription 
      factors but may rather be involved in p53-associated myoblast apoptosis during 
      early myogenesis.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sanhuang Xiexin Decoction (SHXXD) is a classic 
      prescription for the treatment of diabetes. Excessive hepatic glucose production 
      (HGP) is a major determinant of the occurrence and development of diabetes. 
      Inhibition of HGP can significantly improve type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). AIM 
      OF THE STUDY: To investigate the mechanism by which SHXXD inhibits HGP. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: First, a mouse model of T2DM was established through high-fat diet 
      (HFD) feeding combined with streptozotocin (STZ) injection to determine the 
      pharmacodynamic effect of SHXXD in T2DM mice. Then, the possible pathways induced 
      by SHXXD in the treatment of T2DM were predicted by network pharmacology combined 
      with transcriptomics (including target prediction, network analysis and 
      enrichment analysis). Finally, the specific mechanism of SHXXD was elucidated by 
      in vitro experiments. RESULTS: In vivo experiments showed that SHXXD reduced 
      fasting blood glucose and alleviated weight loss in T2DM mice. Improved glucose 
      clearance rates and insulin sensitivity improve dyslipidemia, liver tissue 
      structural abnormalities and inflammatory cell infiltration as well as increase 
      glycogen storage in T2DM mice. The results of network pharmacology and 
      transcriptome analysis showed that SHXXD contained 378 compounds and 2625 
      targets. In total, 292 intersection targets were identified between the 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the liver tissue insulin resistance (IR) 
      related dataset GSE23343. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the 
      insulin/PI3K-Akt/FoxO signaling pathway may be related to SHXXD-mediated 
      improvements in T2DM. In vitro experimental results showed that SHXXD increased 
      glucose consumption by HepG2-IR cells and improved their insulin sensitivity. 
      RT‒qPCR and Western blotting results showed that SHXXD inhibited hepatic 
      gluconeogenesis through the insulin/PI3K-Akt/FoxO signaling pathway by promoting 
      IGFIR, PIK3R1 and AKT2 expression and subsequently inhibiting PEPCK and FBP1 
      expression via phosphorylation of Foxo1. In addition, PI3K/Akt deactivated 
      p-GSK3β through phosphorylation, thereby promoting GS expression and increasing 
      glycogen synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: SHXXD can target the liver to cooperate with the 
      insulin/PI3K-Akt/FoxO signaling pathway to inhibit HGP to alleviate T2DM.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects the formation of carotid atherosclerotic 
      plaques (CAPs) and patients are prone to plaque instability. It is crucial to 
      clarify transcriptomics profiles and identify biomarkers related to the 
      progression of T2DM complicated by CAPs. Ten human CAP samples were obtained, and 
      whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed. Samples were divided into 
      two groups: diabetes mellitus (DM) versus non-DM groups and unstable versus 
      stable groups. The Limma package in R was used to identify lncRNAs, circRNAs, and 
      mRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      (KEGG) pathway analyses, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network creation, and 
      module generation were performed for differentially expressed mRNAs. Cytoscape 
      was used to create a transcription factor (TF)-mRNA regulatory network, 
      lncRNA/circRNA-mRNA co-expression network, and a competitive endogenous RNA 
      (ceRNA) network. The GSE118481 dataset and RT-qPCR were used to verify potential 
      mRNAs.The regulatory network was constructed based on the verified core genes and 
      the relationships were extracted from the above network. In total, 180 
      differentially expressed lncRNAs, 343 circRNAs, and 1092 mRNAs were identified in 
      the DM versus non-DM group; 240 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 390 circRNAs, 
      and 677 mRNAs were identified in the unstable versus stable group. Five circRNAs, 
      14 lncRNAs, and 171 mRNAs that were common among all four groups changed in the 
      same direction. GO/KEGG functional enrichment analysis showed that 171 mRNAs were 
      mainly related to biological processes, such as immune responses, inflammatory 
      responses, and cell adhesion. Five circRNAs, 14 lncRNAs, 46 miRNAs, and 54 mRNAs 
      in the ceRNA network formed a regulatory relationship.

      MIR4435-1HG-hsa-miR-30b-3p-RAB37, and GAS5-hsa-miR-30b-3p-RAB37 may be potential 
      RNA regulatory pathways. Seven upregulated mRNAs were verified using the 
      GSE118481 dataset and RT-qPCR. The regulatory network included seven mRNAs, five 
      circRNAs, six lncRNAs, and 14 TFs. We propose five circRNAs (hsacirc_028744, 
      hsacirc_037219, hsacirc_006308, hsacirc_013887, and hsacirc_045622), six lncRNAs 
      (EPB41L4A-AS1, LINC00969, GAS5, MIR4435-1HG, MIR503HG, and SNHG16), and seven 
      mRNAs (RAB37, CCR7, CD3D, TRAT1, VWF, ICAM2, and TMEM244) as potential biomarkers 
      related to the progression of T2DM complicated with CAP. The constructed ceRNA 
      network has important implications for potential RNA regulatory pathways.

TI  - Investigating the effects of Ceylon cinnamon water extract on HepG2 cells for 
      Type 2 diabetes therapy.

AB  - Cinnamon and its extracts have been used as herbal remedies for many ailments, 
      including for reducing insulin resistance and diabetes complications. Type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a rapidly growing health concern around the world. 
      Although many drugs are available for T2DM treatment, side effects and costs can 
      be considerable, and there is increasing interest in natural products for 
      managing chronic health conditions. Cinnamon may decrease the expression of genes 
      associated with T2DM risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects 
      of cinnamon water extract (CWE) compared with metformin on T2DM-related gene 
      expression. HepG2 human hepatoma cells, widely used in drug metabolism and 
      hepatotoxicity studies, were treated with different concentrations of metformin 
      or CWE for 24 or 48 h. Cell viability was assessed by MTT 
      (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) 
      assay and glucose uptake was compared in untreated and CWE- or metformin-treated 
      cells under high-glucose conditions. Finally, total RNA was extracted and 
      analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and bioinformatics analyses were performed 
      to compare the transcriptional effects of CWE and metformin. We found cell 
      viability was better in cells treated with CWE than in metformin-treated cells, 
      demonstrating that CWE was not toxic at tested doses. CWE significantly increased 
      glucose uptake in HepG2 cells, to the same degree as metformin (1.4-fold). 
      RNA-seq data revealed CWE and metformin both induced significantly increased 
      (1.3- to 1.4-fold) glucose uptake gene expression compared with untreated 
      controls. Transcriptional differences between CWE and metformin were not 
      significant. The effects of 0.125 mg mL(-1) CWE on gene expression were 
      comparable to 1.5 mg mL(-1) (9.5 mM) metformin. In addition, gene expression at 
      0.125 mg mL(-1) CWE was comparable to 1.5 mg mL(-1) (9.5 mM) metformin. Our 
      results reveal that CWE's effects on cell viability, glucose uptake, and gene 
      expression in HepG2 cells are comparable to those of metformin, suggesting CWE 
      may be an effective dietary supplement for mitigating T2DM-related metabolic 
      dysfunction.

AB  - Around 9% of the adult population in the world (463 million) suffer from diabetes 
      mellitus. Most of them (~90%) belong to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is 
      a common chronic metabolic disorder, and the number of cases has been reported to 
      increase each year. Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat provides a successful animal 
      model to study the pathogenesis of T2DM. Although previous hepatic transcriptome 
      studies revealed some novel genes associated with the occurrence and development 
      of T2DM, there still lacks the comprehensive transcriptomic analysis for the 
      liver tissues of ZDF rats. We performed comparative transcriptome analyses 
      between the liver tissues of ZDF rats and healthy ZCL rats and also evaluated 
      several clinical indices. We could identify 214 and 104 differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs) and lncRNAs in ZDF rats, respectively. Pathway and biofunction 
      analyses showed a synergistic effect between mRNAs and lncRNAs. By 
      comprehensively analyzing transcriptomic data and clinical indices, we detected 
      some typical features of T2DM in ZDF rats, such as upregulated metabolism 
      (significant increased lipid absorption/transport/utilization, gluconeogenesis, 
      and protein hydrolysis), increased inflammation, liver injury and increased 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, of the 214 DEGs, 114 were known 
      and 100 were putative T2DM-related genes, most of which have been associated with 
      substance metabolism (particularly degradation), inflammation, liver injury and 
      ER stress biofunctions. Our study provides an important reference and improves 
      understanding of molecular pathogenesis of obesity-associated T2DM. Our data can 
      also be used to identify potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, 
      which should strengthen the prevention and treatment of T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) represents a major global health 
      challenge, marked by chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and immune system 
      dysfunction. Immune cells, including T cells and monocytes, play a pivotal role 
      in driving systemic inflammation in T2DM; however, the underlying single-cell 
      mechanisms remain inadequately defined. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing of 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 37 patients with T2DM and 11 
      healthy controls (HC) was conducted. Immune cell types were identified through 
      clustering analysis, followed by differential expression and pathway analysis. 
      Metabolic heterogeneity within T cell subpopulations was evaluated using Gene Set 
      Variation Analysis (GSVA). Machine learning models were constructed to classify 
      T2DM subtypes based on metabolic signatures, and T-cell-monocyte interactions 
      were explored to assess immune crosstalk. Transcription factor (TF) activity was 
      analyzed, and drug enrichment analysis was performed to identify potential 
      therapeutic targets. RESULTS: In patients with T2DM, a marked increase in 
      monocytes and a decrease in CD4+ T cells were observed, indicating immune 
      dysregulation. Significant metabolic diversity within T cell subpopulations led 
      to the classification of patients with T2DM into three distinct subtypes (A-C), 
      with HC grouped as D. Enhanced intercellular communication, particularly through 
      the MHC-I pathway, was evident in T2DM subtypes. Machine learning models 
      effectively classified T2DM subtypes based on metabolic signatures, achieving an 
      AUC > 0.84. Analysis of TF activity identified pivotal regulators, including 
      NF-kB, STAT3, and FOXO1, associated with immune and metabolic disturbances in 
      T2DM. Drug enrichment analysis highlighted potential therapeutic agents targeting 
      these TFs and related pathways, including Suloctidil, Chlorpropamide, and other 
      compounds modulating inflammatory and metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: This study 
      underscores significant immunometabolic dysfunction in T2DM, characterized by 
      alterations in immune cell composition, metabolic pathways, and intercellular 
      communication. The identification of critical TFs and the development of drug 
      enrichment profiles highlight the potential for personalized therapeutic 
      strategies, emphasizing the need for integrated immunological and metabolic 
      approaches in T2DM management.

AB  - AIMS: The main objective of this study was to analyze the changes of intestinal 
      microflora and how bile acid metabolic pathways affect lipid metabolism in T2DM 
      through the gut-liver axis. METHODS: Firstly, 16S rRNA sequencing, metabolomics 
      and transcriptomic sequencing were performed on plasma and feces of clinical 
      subjects to determine the changes of intestinal flora and its metabolites. 
      Finally, T2DM mice model was verified in vivo. RESULTS: T2DM patients have 
      significant intestinal flora metabolism disorders. The differential fecal 
      metabolites were mainly enriched in primary bile acid biosynthesis and 
      cholesterol metabolism pathways in T2DM patients. After verification, the changes 
      in gut microbiota and metabolites in T2DM patients (including up-regulated 
      bacteria associated with BA metabolism, such as lactobacillus and 
      bifidobacterial, and down-regulated bacteria capable of producing SCFAs such as 
      Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Romboutsia and Roseburia); and the changes in the 
      flora and metabolites that result in impairment of intestinal barrier function 
      and changes of protein expression in the blood, intestine and liver of T2DM 
      patients (including FGFR4↑, TRPM5↑ and CYP27A1↓, which are related to BA and 
      lipid metabolism homeostasis, and TLR6↑, MYD88↑ and NF-κB↑, which are related to 
      inflammatory response). These aspects together contribute to the development of 
      further disorders of glucolipid metabolism and systemic inflammation in T2DM 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in intestinal flora and its metabolites may affect 
      lipid metabolism and systemic inflammatory response in T2DM patients through the 
      gut-liver axis mediated by bile acids.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Camellia oleifera flower (COF) is rich in flavonoids and polyphenols, 
      strongly preventing postprandial hyperglycemia and improving diabetes. However, 
      research on the effective ingredients in COF extracts that have hypoglycemic 
      effects is limited, and the mechanism by which COF extracts improve liver insulin 
      resistance and glucose and lipid metabolism still needs to be clarified, 
      requiring further investigation. AIM: To systematically clarify the role of COF 
      extracts in improving insulin resistance in diabetes mice and to explore their 
      key targets and mechanisms in anti-type 2 diabetes (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Ultrafiltration combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-MS) 
      was used to analyze α-glucosidase inhibitors in COF extracts qualitatively. Blood 
      glucose, lipid, oxidative stress, and liver function indicators were detected in 
      the db/db type 2 diabetes mouse model. Then, RNA-seq was used to identify 
      differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) in the liver, screen for key genes and 
      metabolic pathways, and validate the results' accuracy through qPCR experiments. 
      RESULTS: 17 α-glucosidase inhibitors were identified as flavonoids from COF. 
      Through db/db type 2 diabetes mouse model, it was indicated that COF could 
      significantly improve symptoms of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, alleviate 
      oxidative stress, and protect liver and pancreatic tissues by regulating key 
      differential genes expressed, including Nek2, Cdk1, Ccnb1, and Ccnb2 via the p53 
      signaling pathway and ameliorate the insulin resistance effect. CONCLUSION: This 
      study demonstrated the anti-diabetic effect of COF, explored its potential 
      hypoglycemic target, and provided data support for future T2DM prevention and 
      drug treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is widely prevalent worldwide, and 
      respiratory tract infections (RTIs) have become the primary cause of death for 
      T2DM patients who develop concurrent infections. Among these, Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa infection has been found to exhibit a high mortality rate and poor 
      prognosis and is frequently observed in bacterial infections that are concurrent 
      with COVID-19. Studies have suggested that acarbose can be used to treat T2DM and 
      reduce inflammation. Our objective was to explore the effect of acarbose on P. 
      aeruginosa RTI in T2DM individuals and elucidate its underlying mechanism. 
      METHODS: High-fat diet (HFD) induction and P. aeruginosa inhalation were used to 
      establish a RTI model in T2DM mice. The effect and mechanism of acarbose 
      administered by gavage on P. aeruginosa RTI were investigated in T2DM and 
      nondiabetic mice using survival curves, pathological examination, and 
      transcriptomics. RESULTS: We found that P. aeruginosa RTI was more severe in T2DM 
      mice than in nondiabetic individuals, which could be attributed to the activation 
      of the NF-κB and TREM-1 signaling pathways. When acarbose alleviated P. 
      aeruginosa RTI in T2DM mice, both HIF-1α and NF-κB signaling pathways were 
      inhibited. Furthermore, inhibition of the calcium ion signaling pathway and NF-κB 
      signaling pathway contributed to the attenuation of P. aeruginosa RTI by acarbose 
      in nondiabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the attenuating effect of 
      acarbose on P. aeruginosa RTIs in T2DM and nondiabetic mice and investigated its 
      mechanism, providing novel support for its clinical application in related 
      diseases.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrrosia petiolosa (Christ) Ching (YBSW) is a 
      Traditional Chinese medicine rich in chlorogenic acids. It is an important 
      component in many Traditional Chinese medicinal hypoglycemic formulas and is 
      commonly used by the Miao people to treat diabetes with good efficacy. Our 
      previous research has suggested that chlorogenic acids may be the active 
      ingredients in YBSW. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the mechanisms underlying the 
      anti-type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) hypoglycemic effects of chlorogenic acids 
      contained in YBSW. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo experiments, hematoxylin-eosin 
      staining (HE) staining, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to determine the 
      effects of chlorogenic acids contained in YBSW in rats. mRNA expression 
      profiling, microarray analysis, and network pharmacology were used to analyze the 
      underlying mechanisms of the effects. Finally, apoptosis and changes in the 
      related pathways were evaluated in vitro using a 
      3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thia-zolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence (IF) 
      assessment, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: After the administration of 
      isochlorogenic acid B, the levels of triglycerides, serum total cholesterol, and 
      fasting blood glucose significantly decreased. HE and IHC staining revealed that 
      isochlorogenic acid B significantly increased insulin expression in islet cells. 
      Using network pharmacology and RNA-seq Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      pathway enrichment analysis, we screened the advanced glycation end 
      products-receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE-RAGE) signaling 
      pathway. We also verified that YBSW and its chlorogenic acid can inhibit 
      apoptosis and downregulate the expression of related mRNA in the AGE-RAGE pathway 
      in RIN-m5f cells. CONCLUSIONS: YBSW exhibits a significant hypoglycemic effect, 
      with chlorogenic acid being an effective component. The therapeutic effect of 
      chlorogenic acids contained in YBSW is mainly realized by promoting insulin 
      secretion and pancreatic tissue repair. Moreover, YBSW substantially mitigates 
      apoptosis via the AGE-RAGE pathway in T2DM.

AB  - Deterioration in glucose homeostasis has been associated with intestinal 
      dysbiosis, but it is not known how metabolic dysregulation alters the 
      gastrointestinal environment. We investigated how the progression of diabetes 
      alters ileal and colonic epithelial mucosal structure, microbial abundance, and 
      transcript expression in the University of California Davis Type 2 Diabetes 
      Mellitus (UCD-T2DM) rat model. Male UCD-T2DM rats (age ~170 days) were included 
      if <1-month (n = 6, D1M) or 3-month (n = 6, D3M) post-onset of diabetes. Younger 
      nondiabetic UCD-T2DM rats were included as a nondiabetic comparison (n = 6, ND, 
      age ~70 days). Ileum villi height/crypt depths and colon crypt depths were 
      assessed by histology. Microbial abundance of colon content was measured with 16S 
      rRNA sequencing. Ileum and colon transcriptional abundances were analyzed using 
      RNA sequencing. Ileum villi height and crypt depth were greater in D3M rats 
      compared to ND. Colon crypt depth was greatest in D3M rats compared to both ND 
      and D1M rats. Colon abundances of Akkermansia and Muribaculaceae were lower in 
      D3M rats relative to D1M, while Oscillospirales, Phascolarctobacterium, and an 
      unidentified genus of Lachnospiraceae were higher. Only two transcripts were 
      altered by diabetes advancement within the colon; however, 2039 ileal transcripts 
      were altered. Only colonic abundances of Sptlc3, Enpp7, Slc7a15, and Kctd14 had 
      more than twofold changes between D1M and D3M rats. The advancement of diabetes 
      in the UCD-T2DM rat results in a trophic effect on the mucosal epithelia and was 
      associated with regulation of gastrointestinal tract RNA expression, which 
      appears more pronounced in the ileum relative to the colon.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that increases fracture risk and 
      interferes with bone formation and impairs fracture healing. Genomic studies on 
      diabetes and fracture healing are lacking. We used a weighted co-expression 
      network analysis (WGCNA) method to identify susceptibility modules and hub genes 
      associated with T2DM and fracture healing. First, we downloaded the GSE95849, 
      GSE93213, GSE93215, and GSE142786 data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
      website, analyzed differential expression genes and constructed a WGCNA network. 
      Second, we screened out 30 hub genes, which were found to be enriched in 
      neutrophil activation, translational initiation, RAGE receptor binding, 
      propanoate metabolism, and other pathways through Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
      analyses. Third, we searched for genes related to bone metabolism and fracture 
      healing in the published genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, 
      built a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with hub genes, and found that 
      they were associated with metabolic process, blood vessel development, and 
      extracellular matrix organization. ANXA3 was identified as the biomarker based on 
      gene expression and correlation analysis. And the AUC value of it was 0.947. 
      Fourth, we explored that ANXA3 was associated with neutrophils in fracture 
      healing process by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Finally, we collected 
      clinical patient samples and verified the expression of ANXA3 by qRT-PCR in 
      patents with T2DM and fracture non-union. In conclusion, this is the first 
      genomics study on the effect of T2DM on fracture healing. Our study identified 
      some characteristic modules and hub genes in the etiology of T2DM-associated 
      fracture non-union, which may help to further investigate the molecular 
      mechanisms. Up-regulated ANXA3 potentially contributed to fracture non-union in 
      T2DM by mediating neutrophils. It can be a prognostic biomarker and potential 
      therapeutic target.

AB  - The liver plays an important role in glucose regulation, and their dysfunction is 
      closely associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 
      insulin resistance (IR) in hepatocyte mediate the pathogenesis of diabetes 
      mellitus. In T2DM rats and their correlated control, we investigated various 
      genes expression at transcriptional and translational level by utilizing 
      transcriptomic using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics using isobaric tags 
      for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) to disclose potential candidates 
      for Type 2 diabetes diagnosis and therapy. We found the lecithin retinol 
      acyltransferase (Lrat) gene regulate hepatocyte IR in T2DM. Furthermore, BRL-3A 
      cells, rat liver cells, worked as the IR model in vitro study. Hence, Lrat gene 
      was overexpressed in BRL-3A cells to explore the role of Lrat gene in IR by 
      measuring the cellular glucose consumption, TCHO, and LDL-C levels. Finally, we 
      found that Lrat gene can improve the level of glycolipid metabolism in BRL-3A 
      cells and reduce the degree of IR in BRL-3A cells. Therefore, further exploration 
      of Lrat gene related molecular mechanism is meaningful.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicle Encapsulated MicroRNAs in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Are 
      Affected by Metformin Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8050617 [doi]
LID - 617
AB  - Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), have 
      emerged as a source of potential biomarkers for various pathophysiological 
      conditions, including metabolic disorders such as diabetes. Type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM), is the most prevalent form of diabetes in the USA, with 30 
      million diagnosed patients. Identifying miRNA biomarkers that can be used to 
      assess response to glucose lowering treatments would be useful. Using patient 
      plasma samples from a subset of the Danish Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal 
      Tract (MetaHIT) cohort, we characterized miRNAs from whole plasma, plasma-derived 
      EVs, and EV-depleted plasma by small RNA-sequencing to identify T2DM associated 
      miRNAs. We identified several miRNAs that exhibited concentration changes between 
      controls and non-metformin treated T2DM patients and we validated a subset of 
      these by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 
      The results showed that the concentrations of many T2DM-affected miRNAs in EV 
      (but not in whole or EV-depleted plasma) decreased to levels close to those of 
      healthy controls following metformin treatment. Among other potential uses of 
      these differentially expressed miRNAs, some might be useful in assessing the 
      response to metformin in T2DM patients.

TI  - Identification of adipose tissue-derived exosomal microRNA as a novel causal 
      biomarker for cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus: Triangulating 
      evidence from Mendelian randomization and multicentre population studies.
PG  - 1265-1275
LID - 10.1111/dom.16121 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To explore serum exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) as risk biomarkers for early 
      detection of cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included two phases: a discovery phase and a 
      validation phase. To detect adipose tissue exosomal biomarkers for T2DM patients, 
      small RNA sequencing was conducted on a discovery population consisting of six 
      T2DM patients and five subjects with normal glucose tolerance. To identify miRNAs 
      with causal effects on cognitive impairment, Mendelian randomization (MR) 
      analysis using publicly available genome wide association studies (GWAS) datasets 
      was performed. Relationships between serum exosomal miRNAs and cognitive 
      impairment were evaluated in a training population of 207 T2DM patients, and 
      further validated in an external population of 101 T2DM patients from multiple 
      centres. RESULTS: In the discovery phase, 13 exosomal miRNAs were significantly 
      upregulated in adipose tissue of T2DM patients. MR analyses identified that 
      increased miR-125a-5p was causally associated with increased Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) risk (OR = 1.231, 95% CI 1.062-1.426). In the validation phase, higher serum 
      exosomal miR-125a-5p levels were related to increased amnestic mild cognitive 
      impairment (aMCI) risk (OR = 1.066, 95% CI 1.030-1.103) and reduced left 
      hippocampal body volume (r = -0.189, p < 0.05), achieving an area under the curve 
      (AUC) of 0.728 for identifying aMCI in T2DM patients. External validation 
      confirmed a diagnostic AUC of 0.738. CONCLUSIONS: Serum exosomal miR-125a-5p 
      derived from adipose tissue can serve as a causal biomarker for cognitive 
      impairment in T2DM patients.

TI  - Effect of Anti-Osteoporotic Treatments on Circulating and Bone MicroRNA Patterns 
      in Osteopenic ZDF Rats.

AB  - Bone fragility is an adverse outcome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The 
      underlying molecular mechanisms have, however, remained largely unknown. 
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that control gene expression in 
      health and disease states. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      genome-wide regulation of miRNAs in T2DM bone disease by analyzing serum and bone 
      tissue samples from a well-established rat model of T2DM, the Zucker Diabetic 
      Fatty (ZDF) model. We performed small RNA-sequencing analysis to detect 
      dysregulated miRNAs in the serum and ulna bone of the ZDF model under placebo and 
      also under anti-sclerostin, PTH, and insulin treatments. The dysregulated 
      circulating miRNAs were investigated for their cell-type enrichment to identify 
      putative donor cells and were used to construct gene target networks. Our results 
      show that unique sets of miRNAs are dysregulated in the serum (n = 12, FDR < 0.2) 
      and bone tissue (n = 34, FDR < 0.2) of ZDF rats. Insulin treatment was found to 
      induce a strong dysregulation of circulating miRNAs which are mainly involved in 
      metabolism, thereby restoring seven circulating miRNAs in the ZDF model to normal 
      levels. The effects of anti-sclerostin treatment on serum miRNA levels were 
      weaker, but affected miRNAs were shown to be enriched in bone tissue. PTH 
      treatment did not produce any effect on circulating or bone miRNAs in the ZDF 
      rats. Altogether, this study provides the first comprehensive insights into the 
      dysregulation of bone and serum miRNAs in the context of T2DM and the effect of 
      insulin, PTH, and anti-sclerostin treatments on circulating miRNAs.

AB  - AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is prevalent in the population, with inadequate 
      intake, impaired absorption and metabolism as the main causative factors. VDD 
      increases the risk of developing chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN), but the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying this phenomenon are not known. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the association and potential mechanisms of vitamin D levels with the 
      progression of DN by analyzing general clinical data and using bioinformatics 
      methods. METHODS: The study included 567 diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) patients 
      from the Rocket Force Characteristic Medical Center as the case group and 221 
      healthy examinees as the normal control group. T2DM patients were categorized 
      into T2DM, early diabetic nephropathy (EDN), and advanced diabetic nephropathy 
      (ADN) based on the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The renal RNA-seq and 
      scRNA-seq data of patients with DN were mined from public databases, and the 
      differential expression of vitamin D-related genes in normal-EDN-ADN was analyzed 
      by bioinformatics method, protein interaction network was constructed, immune 
      infiltration was evaluated, single cell map was drawn, and potential mechanisms 
      of VD and DN interaction were explored. RESULTS: Chi-square test showed that 
      vitamin D level was significantly negatively correlated with DN progression 
      (p < 0.001). Bioinformatics showed that the expression of vitamin D-related 
      cytochrome P450 family genes was down-regulated, and TLR4 and other related 
      inflammatory genes were abnormally up-regulated with the progression of DN. 
      Vitamin D metabolism disturbance up-regulate "Nf-Kappa B signaling pathway," B 
      cell receptor signaling pathway and other immune regulation and insulin 
      resistance related pathways, and inhibit a variety of metabolic pathways. In 
      addition, vitamin D metabolism disturbance are strongly associated with the 
      development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and several neurological disease 
      complications. CONCLUSION: VDD or vitamin D metabolism disturbance is positively 
      associated with the severity of renal injury. The mechanisms may involve abnormal 
      regulation of the immune system by vitamin D metabolism disturbance, metabolic 
      suppression, upregulation of insulin resistance and inflammatory signalling 
      pathways.

TI  - Screening of circular RNAs and validation of circANKRD36 associated with 
      inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1865-1874

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an abundant class of endogenous non‑coding RNAs and 
      are associated with numerous diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, 
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the association between circRNAs 
      and inflammation or inflammatory cytokines in patients with T2DM remains to be 
      fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the 
      expression profiles of circRNAs in peripheral leucocytes of patients with T2DM 
      and their association with inflammatory cytokines. Peripheral blood from patients 
      with T2DM (n=43) and healthy individuals (n=45) were collected for RNA sequencing 
      and later verification. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) 
      and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) 
      analyses were used to detect the expression levels of circRNAs. The expression of 
      inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)‑1, (IL)‑6, and tumor necrosis 
      factor (TNF)‑α were measured via enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, 
      the mRNA expression level of ankyrin repeat domain 36 (ANKRD36), a protein 
      located at 2q11.2 that interacts with the GAPDH gene, was measured using RT‑qPCR 
      analysis. The circRNA/microRNA (miRNA) interaction was predicted using RegRNA and 
      mirPath software. In total, 220 circRNAs were found to be differentially 
      expressed between patients with T2DM and healthy individuals, of which 107 were 
      upregulated and 113 were downregulated. Among the nine selected circRNAs, 
      circANKRD36 was significantly upregulated in patients with T2DM compared with 
      control subjects (P=0.02). The expression level of circANKRD36 was positively 
      correlated with glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (r=0.3250, P=0.0047 and 
      r=0.3171, P=0.0056, respectively). The expression level of IL‑6 was significantly 
      different between the T2DM group and control group (P=0.028) and was positively 
      correlated with circANKRD36. The difference of circANKRD36 host gene expression 
      between patients with T2DM and healthy controls was significant (P=0.04). Taken 
      together, circANKRD36 may be involved in T2DM and inflammation‑associated 
      pathways via interaction with miRNAs, including hsa‑miR‑3614‑3p, hsa‑miR‑498, and 
      hsa‑miR‑501‑5p. The expression of circANKRD36 was up-regulated in peripheral 
      blood leucocytes and was correlated with chronic inflammation in T2DM. Therefore, 
      circANKRD36 can be used as a potential biomarker for screening chronic 
      inflammation in patients with T2DM.

AB  - Glycemic variability (GV) markedly exacerbates cognitive impairment in elderly 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), in part through chronic 
      inflammation. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the NLRP3 
      inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 in mitigating GV-induced cognitive impairment in an 
      aged rat model of T2DM. Aged Sprague-Dawley rats with induced T2DM were subjected 
      to GV conditions, and the effects of MCC950 were evaluated through measurement of 
      body weight, blood glucose, lipid profiles, insulin level, inflammatory markers, 
      and cognitive function. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on the hippocampus 
      and prefrontal cortex. Treatment with MCC950 significantly alleviated weight loss 
      and hyperglycemia in the GV group compared with the control group. MCC950 also 
      reduced the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and pro-inflammatory markers 
      (interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18)). Most notably, MCC950 
      improved spatial learning and memory retention in the GV group. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a reduction in inflammasome activation and 
      an increase in the expression level of the neuronal marker NeuN in the 
      hippocampus. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MCC950 altered neuroactive 
      ligand-receptor interaction pathways in the hippocampus and influenced receptor 
      binding and cell adhesion processes in the prefrontal cortex. These findings 
      validated the efficacy of NLRP3 inhibitor in mitigating GV-induced cognitive 
      impairment in elderly rats with T2DM and provided the basis for subsequent 
      clinical studies exploring the broader potential of NLRP3-targeted interventions 
      in addressing diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common diabetes complication and was 
      considered as the major cause of blindness among young adults. MiRNAs are a group 
      of small non-coding RNAs regulating the expression of target genes and have been 
      reported to be associated with the development of DR in a variety of molecular 
      mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs that are differentially 
      expressed (DE) in the serum of DR patients. Methods: We recruited 21 type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inpatients of Chinese Han ancestry, consisting of 10 
      non-proliferative DR patients (DR group) and 11 non-DR T2DM patients (NDR group). 
      MiRNA was extracted from fasting peripheral serum and quantified by RNA-seq. The 
      expression levels of miRNA were evaluated and compared between the two groups, 
      with adjustments made for age differences. The validated target genes of miRNAs 
      were subjected to a pathway analysis. We also constructed a weighted polygenic 
      risk score using the DE miRNA and evaluated its predictive power. Results: Five 
      miRNAs were DE between DR and NDR groups (p-Value ≤ 0.01, LFC ≥ 2 or LFC ≤-2). 
      These included miR-4448, miR-338-3p, miR-190a-5p, miR-485-5p, and miR-9-5p. In 
      total, these miRNAs were validated to regulate 55 target genes. Four target genes 
      were found to overlap with the NAD metabolism, sirtuin, and aging pathway, which 
      was thought to control the vascular growth and morphogenesis. The predictive 
      power of our polygenic risk score was apparently high (AUC = 0.909). However, it 
      needs to be interpreted with caution. Conclusion: In this study, we discovered 
      novel DR-specific miRNAs in human serum samples. These circulating miRNAs may 
      represent the pathological changes in the retina in response to diabetes and may 
      serve as non-invasive biomarkers for early DR risk prediction.

AB  - Diabetes (DM) has a significant impact on public health. We performed an in 
      silico study of paired datasets of messenger RNA (mRNA) micro-RNA (miRNA) 
      transcripts to delineate potential biosignatures that could distinguish 
      prediabetes (pre-DM), type-1DM (T1DM) and type-2DM (T2DM). Two publicly available 
      datasets containing expression values of mRNA and miRNA obtained from individuals 
      diagnosed with pre-DM, T1DM or T2DM, and normoglycemic controls (NC), were 
      analyzed using systems biology approaches to define combined signatures to 
      distinguish different clinical groups. The mRNA profile of both pre-DM and T2DM 
      was hallmarked by several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to NC. 
      Nevertheless, T1DM was characterized by an overall low number of DEGs. The miRNA 
      signature profiles were composed of a substantially lower number of 
      differentially expressed targets. Gene enrichment analysis revealed several 
      inflammatory pathways in T2DM and fewer in pre-DM, but with shared findings such 
      as Tuberculosis. The integration of mRNA and miRNA datasets improved the 
      identification and discriminated the group composed by pre-DM and T2DM patients 
      from that constituted by normoglycemic and T1DM individuals. The integrated 
      transcriptomic analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed a unique 
      biosignature able to characterize different types of DM.

AB  - Background: Islet dysfunction is the main pathological process of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM). Fibrosis causes islet dysfunction, but the current mechanism is 
      still unclear. Here, bioinformatics analysis identified gene clusters closely 
      related to T2DM and differentially expressed genes related to fibrosis, and 
      animal models verified the roles of these genes. Methods: Human islet 
      transcriptomic datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and 
      weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to screen the key 
      gene modules related to T2DM and analyze the correlations between the modules and 
      clinical characteristics. Enrichment analysis was performed to identify the 
      functions and pathways of the key module genes. WGCNA, protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
      analysis were used to screen the hub genes. The hub genes were verified in 
      another GEO dataset, the islets of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Sprague-Dawley rats 
      were observed by H&E and Masson's trichrome staining, the fibrotic proteins were 
      verified by immunofluorescence, and the hub genes were tested by 
      immunohistochemistry. Results: The top 5,000 genes were selected according to the 
      median absolute deviation, and 18 modules were analyzed. The yellow module was 
      highly associated with T2DM, and its positive correlation with glycated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly stronger than that with body mass index 
      (BMI). Enrichment analysis revealed that extracellular matrix organization, the 
      collagen-containing extracellular matrix and cytokine-cytokine receptor 
      interaction might influence T2DM progression. The top three hub genes, 
      interleukin 6 (IL6), IL11 and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), 
      showed upregulated expression in T2DM. In the validation dataset, IL6, IL11, and 
      PTGS2 levels were upregulated in T2DM, and IL6 and PTGS2 expression was 
      positively correlated with HbA1c and BMI; however, IL11 was positively correlated 
      only with HbA1c. In HFD-fed Sprague-Dawley rats, the positive of IL6 and IL11 in 
      islets was stronger, but PTGS2 expression was not significantly altered. The 
      extent of fibrosis, irregular cellular arrangement and positive actin alpha 2 
      (ACTA2) staining in islets was significantly greater in HFD-fed rats than in 
      normal diet-fed rats. Conclusion: Glucotoxicity is a major factor leading to 
      increased IL6 and IL11 expression, and IL6-and IL11-induced fibrosis might be 
      involved in islet dysfunction.

AB  - In this work, we tested the hypothesis that the development of dementia in 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) requires a genetic background of 
      predisposition to neurodegenerative disease. As a proof of concept, we induced 
      T2DM in middle-aged hAPP NL/F mice, a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease. 
      We show that T2DM produces more severe behavioral, electrophysiological, and 
      structural alterations in these mice compared with wild-type mice. 
      Mechanistically, the deficits are not paralleled by higher levels of toxic forms 
      of Aβ or by neuroinflammation but by a reduction in γ-secretase activity, lower 
      levels of synaptic proteins, and by increased phosphorylation of tau. RNA-seq 
      analysis of the cerebral cortex of hAPP NL/F and wild-type mice suggests that the 
      former could be more susceptible to T2DM because of defects in trans-membrane 
      transport. The results of this work, on the one hand, confirm the importance of 
      the genetic background in the severity of the cognitive disorders in individuals 
      with T2DM and, on the other hand, suggest, among the involved mechanisms, the 
      inhibition of γ-secretase activity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease that involves 
      autoimmunity. However, how immune cells function in the peripheral blood remains 
      unclear. Exploring T2DM biomarkers via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
      could provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The 
      clinical trial registration number is ChiCTR2100049613. In this study, we 
      included three healthy participants and three T2DM patients. The observed 
      clinical indicators included weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated 
      haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting insulin levels. Direct separation and 
      purification of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were performed via the 
      Ficoll density gradient centrifugation method. Immune cell types were identified 
      via scRNA-seq. The differentially expressed genes, biological functions, cell 
      cycle dynamics, and correlations between blood glucose indicators and genes in 
      different cell types were analysed. RESULTS: There were differences between the 
      healthy and T2DM groups in terms of FBG and HbA1c (p<0.05 or p<0.01). We profiled 
      13,591 cells and 3188 marker genes from PBMCs. B cells, T cells, monocytes, and 
      NK cells were grouped into 4 subclusters from PBMCs. CD4+ T cells are mainly in 
      the memory activation stage, and CD8+ T cells are effectors. Monocytes include 
      mainly CD14+ monocytes and FCGR3A+ monocytes. There were 119 differentially 
      expressed genes in T cells and 175 differentially expressed genes in monocytes. 
      Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the marker genes were enriched in 
      HALLMARK_ INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE and HALLMARK_TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_ NFKB. 
      Moreover, TNFRSF1A was identified as the core gene involved in network 
      interactions in T cells. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a transcriptional map of 
      immune cells from PBMCs and provides a framework for understanding the immune 
      status and potential immune mechanisms of T2DM patients via scRNA-seq. CLINICAL

AB  - Recently, a wide range of biological and pathological roles of long noncoding 
      RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered. However, the potential role of circulating 
      lncRNAs H19 and GAS5 in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) is not clear. Here, we assessed the plasma levels of H19 and GAS5 lncRNAs in 
      T2DM patients with/without DR and evaluated if H19 and GAS5 pre-treatment plasma 
      levels are a predictor of early response to a single aflibercept dose in DR 
      subgroup. Plasma lncRNA expression profiles of 119 T2DM patients (66 with DR and 
      53 without DR) and 110 healthy controls were determined by quantitative reverse 
      transcription PCR. The association of lncRNA expression profiles with clinical 
      features and aflibercept early response in DR patients was investigated. Relative 
      H19 expression levels were significantly increased in T2DM group (including DR 
      and non-DR subgroups) vs. controls, while GAS5 levels were decreased in T2DM 
      group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in H19 and GAS5 expression 
      levels between DR and non-DR subgroups. H19 and GAS5 expression profiles were not 
      significantly correlated with clinical parameters or response to aflibercept 
      therapy in DR subgroup. Our findings indicate that the circulating lncRNAs H19 
      and GAS5 may be associated with T2DM prevalence but may not have an important 
      diagnostic/prognostic role in DR or early response to aflibercept intravitreal 
      injection in DR patients. Large-scale transcriptomic studies are warranted to 
      validate our results and investigate other lncRNA candidates in T2DM.

TI  - Insulin and circadian rhythm genes of the Nile rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) are 
      conserved and orthologous to those in the rat, mouse and human.

AB  - The African grass or Nile rat (NR) (Arvicanthis niloticus) is a herbivorous 
      diurnal rodent which is used as a biological model for research on type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the circadian rhythm. Similar to humans, male NRs 
      develop T2DM with high-carbohydrate diets. The NR thus provides a unique 
      opportunity to identify the nutritional and underlying genetic factors that 
      characterise human T2DM, as well as the effects of potential anti-diabetic 
      phytochemicals such as Water-Soluble Palm Fruit Extract. Whole genome sequencing 
      (WGS) could help identify possible genetic causes why NRs spontaneously develop 
      T2DM in captivity. In this study, we performed WGS on a hepatic deoxyribonucleic 
      acid (DNA) sample isolated from a male NR using PacBio high-fidelity long-read 
      sequencing. The WGS data obtained were then de novo assembled and annotated using 
      PacBio HiFi isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) data as well as previous Illumina RNA 
      sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Genes related to insulin and circadian rhythm pathways 
      were present in the NR genome, similar to orthologues in the rat, mouse and human 
      genomes. T2DM development in the NR is thus most likely not attributable to 
      structural differences in these genes when compared to other biological models. 
      Further studies are warranted to gain additional insights on the 
      genetic-environmental factors which underlie the genetic permissiveness of NRs to 
      develop T2DM.

AB  - Lines of evidence have indicated that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an 
      independent risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) progression. However, the study 
      focused on the relationship between T2DM and OA at the transcriptional level 
      remains empty. We downloaded OA- and T2DM-related bulk RNA-sequencing and 
      single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. 
      Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
      (WGCNA) were performed to screen out hub genes between OA and T2DM, and 
      functional enrichment was done. Single-cell sequencing analysis was further used 
      to screen key genes on OA and T2DM datasets. Rat chondrocytes and human articular 
      cartilage were used to validate biomarkers among OA and T2DM. Sixty-eight hub 
      genes were obtained, which were mainly enriched in the inflammatory response. We 
      found that the hub gene TNFAIP6 is not only closely related to OA and T2DM but 
      also a marker of prehypertrophic chondrocytes, which are closely related to the 
      progression of OA. TNFAIP6 was found to be significantly elevated in 
      CD14 + monocytes in T2DM patients, and this group of cells can promote 
      inflammation. Validation on rat chondrocytes and human cartilage showed that 
      TNFAIP6 was highly expressed in OA and further increased in the presence of T2DM 
      or high glucose. Our study identified several characteristic modules and hub 
      genes in the pathogenesis of T2DM-induced OA, which may facilitate further 
      investigation of its molecular mechanisms. Up-regulated TNFAIP6 may contribute to 
      OA in patients with T2DM by the recruitment of pro-inflammatory CD14 + monocytes 
      in the OA synovium, which provides a potential target for the diagnosis and 
      treatment of T2DM-associated OA.

AB  - Chronic oxidative stress resulting from hyperlipidemia is thought to be a key 
      pathogenic driver of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in leading to the onset of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been 
      increasingly recognized to regulate dysfunction within pancreatic β-cells in the 
      context of T2DM. In the present study, we sought to comprehensively analyze the 
      roles of lncRNAs in dysfunctional β-cells and mouse islets. Analyses of INS-1E 
      cells were performed by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR after treating with or without 0.5 mM 
      palmitate for 4 days, leading us to identify the novel lncRNA Eif4g2 (lncEif4g2) 
      as a functional regulator within these cells. When we overexpressed lncEif4g2 in 
      INS-1E β-cells and mouse islets, this was sufficient for the reversal of 
      palmitate-mediated reductions in cell viability, insulin production, ATP 
      production by mitochondria, and creation of intracellular reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) and the dysfunction of mouse islets, with nuclear factor erythroid 2 
      related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation also being observed. In contrast, when 
      lncEif4g2 was knocked down this led INS-1E cells and mouse islets to become more 
      sensitive to palmitate-induced dysfunction, with reduced Nrf2 nuclear 
      translocation also being detected. When antioxidants were used to treat INS-1E 
      cells and mouse islets, however, these negative effects were reversed. Additional 
      functional analyses revealed lncEif4g2 to be capable of directly binding to 
      miR-3074-5p in β-cells, with the expression of lncEif4g2 and miR-3074-5p being 
      negatively correlated with one another. We further found that cAMP-responsive 
      element binding-protein (CREB) was a miR-3074-5p target gene in these cells, thus 
      at least in part serving as a functional mediator of the lncEif4g2/miR-3074-5p 
      axis within dysfunctional β-cells. In summary, our results thus reveal that 
      lncEif4g2 is able to indirectly regulate the expression of CREB via targeting 
      miR-3074-5p in INS-1E cells and mouse islets, thereby leading to enhanced Nrf2 
      activation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity, defined as excessive or abnormal body fat accumulation, 
      which could significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diseases and seriously affect people's quality of life. 
      More than 2 billion people are overweight, and the incidence of obesity is 
      increasing rapidly worldwide, it has become a widely concerned public health 
      issue in the world. Diverse evidence show that active metabolites are involved in 
      the pathophysiological processes of obesity. AIMS: However, whether the 
      downstream catabolite of tryptophan, 3-indole acrylic acid (IA), is involved in 
      obesity remains unclear. METHODS: We collected the samples of serum from 
      peripheral blood of obesity and health controls, and liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to identify the plasma levels of IA. 
      Additionally, we verified the potential benefits of IA on human preadipocytes and 
      HFD- induced zebrafish by cell viability assay, flow cytometry assay, Oil red O 
      staining, total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG) and nonesterified free 
      fatty acids (NEFA) measurements and Nile Red staining. RNA-Seq, functional 
      analysis and western blot revealed the mechanisms underlying the function of IA. 
      RESULTS: We found that the content of IA in peripheral blood serum of overweight 
      people was significantly lower than that of normal people. In addition, 
      supplementation with IA in zebrafish larvae induced by a high fat diet (HFD) 
      dramatically reduced HFD induced lipid accumulation. IA had no effect on 
      proliferation and apoptosis of preadipocytes, but significantly inhibited 
      adipogenesis of preadipocytes by down-regulate CEBPα and PPARγ. RNA-Seq and 
      functional analysis revealed that IA regulated the adipogenesis of preadipocytes 
      through stimulate the phosphorylation of STAT1. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, IA 
      has been identified as a potent metabolite for the prevention or treatment of 
      obesity.

TI  - Anthocyanin-rich extract from black beans exerts anti-diabetic effects in rats 
      through a multi-genomic mode of action in adipose tissue.

AB  - Black beans (BB) are an important source of a range of plant bioactive compounds 
      including polyphenols, particularly anthocyanins. Several studies support that 
      consumption of BB is associated with health benefits, including prevention of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, molecular mechanisms underlying the 
      potential health properties of BB on adipose tissue (AT) are still largely 
      unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate multi-genomic effects of BB 
      intake and identify regulatory networks potentially mediating T2DM on AT. Male 
      Wistar diabetic rats consumed an anthocyanin-rich black bean extract for 5 weeks. 
      Global gene expression from AT, protein coding and non-coding RNA profiles were 
      determined using RNAseq. Biological function analyses were performed using a 
      variety of bioinformatic tools. The evaluation of global gene expression profiles 
      exhibited significant change following BB consumption with 406 significantly 
      differentially expressed genes, 33 miRNA and 39 lncRNA and 3 snRNA. Functional 
      analyses indicated that these genes play an important role in regulation of PI3K 
      signaling, NIN/NF-kB signaling, insulin secretion, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      organization. Interestingly, transcription factors such as GATA2, or POU2AF1 
      demonstrated to modulate their activity by BB extract by direct interaction with 
      polyphenol metabolites, or by interactions with cell signaling proteins, like 
      PKB, AKT or PI3K, that could control transcription factor activity and as a 
      result impact on adipogenesis regulation. Therefore, the constant consumption of 
      an anthocyanin-rich black bean extract may have anti-diabetic protective effects 
      by modulating gene expression, resulting in a promising alternative for T2DM 
      patients.

AB  - High-protein diet is a promising strategy for diabetes treatment supporting body 
      weight control, improving glycaemic status, cardiovascular risk factors and 
      reducing liver fat. Here, we investigated effects of diets high in animal (AP) or 
      plant (PP) protein on oxidative stress and antioxidant status in individuals with 
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 37 obese individuals (age 64.3 ± 1.0 years) with T2DM 
      were randomized to an isocaloric diet (30 energy(E)% protein, 30 E% fat and 40 E% 
      carbohydrates) rich in AP or PP for 6 weeks. Markers of oxidative and nitrosative 
      stress and antioxidant status in plasma and nitrate/nitrite levels in urine were 
      assessed. Gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was analysed by 
      RNA-Seq and real-time PCR. Both AP and PP diets similarly reduced plasma levels 
      of malondialdehyde (P(AP) = 0.003, P(PP) = 1.6 × 10(-4)) and protein carbonyls 
      (P(AP) = 1.2 × 10(-4), P(PP) = 3.0 × 10(-5)) over 6 weeks. Nitrotyrosine (NT) 
      increased upon both AP and PP diets (P(AP) = 0.005, P(PP) = 0.004). SAT 
      expression of genes involved in nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress metabolism 
      and urine NO metabolite (nitrate/nitrite) levels were not changed upon both 
      diets. Plasma levels of carotenoids increased upon PP diet, whereas retinol, 
      alpha- and gamma-tocopherol slightly decreased upon both diets. AP and PP diets 
      similarly improve oxidative stress but increase nitrosative stress markers in 
      individuals with T2DM. Mechanisms of the NT regulation upon high-protein diets 
      need further investigation.

TI  - Interleukin-5: an indicator of mild cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus - a comprehensive investigation ranging from bioinformatics 
      analysis to clinical research.

AB  - PURPOSE: Neuroinflammation constitutes an underlying mechanism for cognitive 
      impairment. Here, we endeavor to scrutinize the potential contribution of 
      interleukin-5 (IL-5) towards mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to assess its 
      diagnostic value for MCI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      METHODS: RNA-seq was used to explore the potential neuroinflammation factors in 
      the hippocampus of diabetic mice with cognitive decline. Additionally, the 
      promising risk factor was verified in animals. Finally, the association between 
      IL-5 levels and cognitive function and its diagnostic value for MCI were 
      assessed. RESULTS: In animals, up-regulated IL-5 mRNA and protein levels were 
      detected by RNA-seq and (or) verified experiments in the hippocampus of diabetic 
      db/db mice with cognitive decline, compared to those of db/m mice without 
      diabetes. In human, compared to diabetic patients without MCI, those with MCI 
      demonstrate elevated levels of IL-5. It is natively associated with Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, reflecting global cognitive function, and 
      positively correlated with Trail Making Test A (TMTA) scores, reflecting 
      information processing speed. Furthermore, an elevated level of IL-5 is 
      identified as a risk factor for MCI, and a factor that influences TMTA scores. 
      Finally, it is recommended that the cut-off value for IL-5 in the diagnosis of 
      MCI is 22.98 pg/mL, with a sensitivity of 68.6% and specificity of 72.9%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IL-5 is considered a risk factor for MCI in T2DM patients and is 
      associated with their performance in information processing speed. Moreover, an 
      elevated level of IL-5 is a plausible biomarker for MCI in T2DM patients.

AB  - As a non-coding RNA, microRNA (miRNA) has been proven to play an important role 
      in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Highland 
      barley is a whole grain from the Tibetan areas of China. Our previous studies 
      have demonstrated its hypoglycemic effect. To further explore the underlining 
      molecular mechanism, we investigated the effect of highland barley intervention 
      on liver miRNA expression profiles in diabetic mice. Our results showed that ten 
      differentially expressed miRNA among different groups were identified and their 
      target genes were predicted. Remarkably, many glycometabolism-associated genes, 
      including Foxo3, Nras, Rptor, Igf1r, Tsc2 and Braf, were negatively regulated by 
      miR-122-5p, miR-503-5p, miR-455-5p and miR-210-3p, respectively. Pathway 
      enrichment analysis revealed these target genes were mainly involved in AMPK, 
      MAPK and FOXO signaling pathways. Thereby, these miRNA and mRNA were validated 
      using qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the small RNA-seq and 
      expectations. Highland barley could regulate the MAPK, AMPK, and FOXO signaling 
      pathways by regulating critical miRNA-mRNA pairs, e.x. miR-210-3p-Tsc2/Braf, 
      miR-122-5p-Foxo3, and miR-455-5p-Igf1r, thereby improving blood glucose 
      metabolism in diabetic mice. The present study preliminarily explored the 
      hypoglycaemic effects of highland barley based on transcriptomics, and more 
      detailed and in-depth studies on this topic are needed in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Through transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, this study examined 
      the role of high-fiber diet in obesity complicated by diabetes and 
      neurodegenerative symptoms. METHOD: The expression matrix of 
      high-fiber-diet-related metabolites, blood methylation profile associated with 
      pre-symptomatic dementia in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM), and high-throughput single-cell sequencing data of hippocampal samples 
      from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were retrieved from the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and through a literature search. Data were 
      analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) after quality control and data 
      filtering to identify different cell clusters and candidate markers. A 
      protein-protein interaction network was mapped using the STRING database. To 
      further investigate the interaction among high-fiber-diet-related metabolites, 
      methylation-related DEGs related to T2DM, and single-cell marker genes related to 
      AD, AutoDock was used for semi-flexible molecular docking. RESULT: Based on GEO 
      database data and previous studies, 24 marker genes associated with high-fiber 
      diet, T2DM, and AD were identified. Top 10 core genes include SYNE1, ANK2, SPEG, 
      PDZD2, KALRN, PTPRM, PTPRK, BIN1, DOCK9, and NPNT, and their functions are 
      primarily related to autophagy. According to molecular docking analysis, 
      acetamidobenzoic acid, the most substantially altered metabolic marker associated 
      with a high-fiber diet, had the strongest binding affinity for SPEG. CONCLUSION: 
      By targeting the SPEG protein in the hippocampus, acetamidobenzoic acid, a 
      metabolite associated with high-fiber diet, may improve diabetic and 
      neurodegenerative diseases in obese people.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been confirmed as an independent risk factor 
      for colorectal cancer (CRC) in many studies. However, the mechanisms behind 
      T2DM's role in the progression of CRC remain unclear. This study aims to explore 
      the potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms involved in T2DM-promoted CRC 
      progression. The limma package was used to identify differentially expressed 
      genes in tumor tissue from CRC patients with or without T2DM. The key biological 
      processes were screened by gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis. A 
      diagnostic model for co-morbidities was constructed by logistic regression model 
      with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regularization 
      method. The diagnostic performance was assessed by supplementing external 
      datasets to draw ROC curves on the diagnostic model. The diagnostic model was 
      further screened for key genes by prognostic analysis. The relationship of key 
      genes with immune cells and other cells was evaluated by immune infiltration 
      algorithm and single-cell transcription analysis. Drug prediction was performed 
      by cMAP and the obtained drugs were molecularly docked with the key genes. The 
      differentially expressed genes of T2DM-promoted CRC progression were mainly 
      enriched to O-linked glycosylation-related processes. The diagnostic model 
      constructed based on Lasso logistic regression had good diagnostic performance 
      (AUC > 0.8). COX11 was the key gene for co-morbidities: in tumor tissues, COX11 
      expression was significantly higher than that in normal colon tissues. However, 
      COX11 gene expression was significantly lower in patients with comorbidities than 
      in patients without T2DM in tumor tissue. External datasets confirmed from both 
      mRNA and protein expression levels that low COX11 expression was significantly 
      associated with poor CRC prognosis. Immune infiltration analysis suggested that 
      its expression related to the proportion of M2 macrophages. Single-cell 
      transcriptome analysis revealed a close association of COX11 expression with 
      endothelial cells and macrophages. The top4 drugs predicted bound well to COX11. 
      Our study revealed that the pathogenesis of T2DM-promoted CRC progression related 
      to O-linked glycosylation. We constructed a diagnostic model for T2DM-CRC 
      co-morbidity. Meanwhile, we identified COX11 as a potential immune-related 
      molecular marker closely associated with T2DM-promoted CRC progression. These 
      mechanisms and molecular markers may provide new ideas for further studies of 
      T2DM-promoted CRC progression and contribute to drug discovery for the treatment 
      of co-morbidities.

TI  - Defective interferon signaling in the circulating monocytes of type 2 diabetic 
      mice.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with poor outcome after stroke. 
      Peripheral monocytes play a critical role in the secondary injury and recovery of 
      damaged brain tissue after stroke, but the underlying mechanisms are largely 
      unclear. To investigate transcriptome changes and molecular networks across 
      monocyte subsets in response to T2DM and stroke, we performed single-cell 
      RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bulk 
      RNA-sequencing from blood monocytes from four groups of adult mice, consisting of 
      T2DM model db/db and normoglycemic control db/+ mice with or without ischemic 
      stroke. Via scRNAseq we found that T2DM expands the monocyte population at the 
      expense of lymphocytes, which was validated by flow cytometry. Among the 
      monocytes, T2DM also disproportionally increased the inflammatory subsets with 
      Ly6C+ and negative MHC class II expression (MO.6C+II-). Conversely, monocytes 
      from control mice without stroke are enriched with steady-state classical 
      monocyte subset of MO.6C+II+ but with the least percentage of MO.6C+II- subtype. 
      Apart from enhancing inflammation and coagulation, enrichment analysis from both 
      scRNAseq and bulk RNAseq revealed that T2DM specifically suppressed type-1 and 
      type-2 interferon signaling pathways crucial for antigen presentation and the 
      induction of ischemia tolerance. Preconditioning by lipopolysaccharide conferred 
      neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury in db/+ but not in db/db mice and 
      coincided with a lesser induction of brain Interferon-regulatory-factor-3 in the 
      brains of the latter mice. Our results suggest that the increased diversity and 
      altered transcriptome in the monocytes of T2DM mice underlie the worse stroke 
      outcome by exacerbating secondary injury and potentiating stroke-induced 
      immunosuppression. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mechanisms involved in the 
      detrimental diabetic effect on stroke are largely unclear. We show here, for the 
      first time, that peripheral monocytes have disproportionally altered the subsets 
      and changed transcriptome under diabetes and/or stroke conditions. Moreover, 
      genes in the IFN-related signaling pathways are suppressed in the diabetic 
      monocytes, which underscores the immunosuppression and impaired ischemic 
      tolerance under the T2DM condition. Our data raise a possibility that 
      malfunctioned monocytes may systemically and focally affect the host, leading to 
      the poor outcome of diabetes in the setting of stroke. The results yield 
      important clues to molecular mechanisms involved in the detrimental diabetic 
      effect on stroke outcome.

      in Drosophila melanogaster.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Herba Wanlenbergiae, named 'Lanhuashen' (LHS) in 
      Chinese, is derived from the dried herba of Wahlenbergia marginata (Thunb.) A.DC. 
      It is an abundant resource that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine 
      (TCM) for over 600 years. LHS has the effects of enriching consumptive disease 
      and relieving deficient heat, consistent with the therapy for type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) in TCM. As the basic remedy of Yulan Jiangtang capsules, a listed 
      Chinese medicine specifically for treating T2DM, LHS is a potential candidate for 
      an anti-T2DM drug. However, due to the lack of pharmacodynamic studies and 
      chemical component analysis, the application and development of LHS as a 
      treatment for T2DM have been hindered. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the 
      regulation of the disorder of glucolipid metabolism using LHS extracts and its 
      therapeutic potential in T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical components in LHS 
      extracts were analysed using UPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS. Subsequently, high 
      sucrose diet (HSD)-induced Drosophila melanogaster were used as suitable models 
      for T2DM in vivo. Behavioural and biochemical tests were performed to evaluate 
      the regulation of the disorder of glucolipid metabolism using LHS in T2DM flies. 
      Furthermore, integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis was applied to 
      reveal the specific effects of LHS extracts on metabolites and genes. Meanwhile, 
      bioinformatic analysis was carried out to predict the targeted transcription 
      factors (TFs) and potentially effective components of LHS extracts. RESULTS: We 
      redefined the chemical profile of LHS with 76 identified chemical components, 
      including 65 chemical components for the first time. As indicated by decreased 
      trehalose, glucose and triglyceride levels and increased total protein levels, 
      LHS extracts were perceived to alleviate the disorder of glucolipid metabolism in 
      HSD-induced T2DM fruit flies. Integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis 
      revealed that LHS extracts eliminated the accumulation of sphingolipids and 
      subsequently stimulated the positive cross-regulation mediated by the sphingosine 
      1-phosphate (S1P) axis, resulting in the activation of the 
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signalling pathway 
      and inhibition of lysosome-mediated apoptosis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 
      that the upstream TFs, transcriptional enhancer factor TEF-5 (TEAD3) and 
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), were the potential 
      targets of atractylenolide III, dihydrokaempferol and syringaldehyde, the 
      potentially effective components of LHS extracts. Therefore, this TF network was 
      plausibly the basis for the efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: LHS extracts broadly modulated 
      TF-dependent gene expression and subsequently stimulated the positive 
      cross-regulation mediated by the S1P axis to ameliorate the disorder of 
      glucolipid metabolism. Our study provides critical evidence considering LHS as a 
      potential drug candidate for T2DM, inspiring the discovery and development of 
      innovative therapeutic agents based on the cross-regulation mediated by the S1P 
      axis for treating T2DM and related complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) transcriptome 
      in comparison to subcutaneous fat (SAT) in coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 
      2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS AND RESULTS: SAT and EAT samples were obtained from 
      subjects with T2DM and CAD (n = 5) and those without CAD with or without T2DM 
      (=3) undergoing elective cardiac surgery. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed 
      in both EAT and SAT. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify pathways 
      affected by the differentially expressed genes. Changes of top genes were 
      verified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot, and immunofluorescence. 
      A total of 592 genes were differentially expressed in diabetic EAT, whereas there 
      was no obvious changes in SAT transcriptome between diabetics and non-diabetics. 
      Diabetic EAT was mainly enriched in inflammatory genes, such as Colony 
      Stimulating Factor 3 (CSF3), Interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6. KEGG pathway analysis 
      confirmed that upregulated genes were involved in inflammatory pathways, such as 
      Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) and advanced glycation 
      end-products-receptor advanced glycation end products (AGE-RAGE). The 
      overexpression of inflammatory genes in diabetic EAT was largely correlated with 
      upregulated transcription factors such as NF-κB and FOS. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic 
      EAT transcriptome is significantly different when compared to diabetic SAT and 
      highly enriched with genes involved in innate immune response and endothelium, 
      like Pentraxin3 (PTX3) and Endothelial lipase G (LIPG). EAT inflammatory genes 
      expression could be induced by upregulated transcription factors, mainly NF-kB 
      and FOSL, primarily activated by the overexpressed AGE-RAGE signaling. This 
      suggests a unique and novel atherogenic pathway in diabetes.

AB  - It is well known that gut microbial imbalance is a potential factor for the 
      occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. 
      Moreover, the heart and gut microbiota can regulate each other through the 
      gut-metabolite-heart axis. In this study, metagenomics, metabolomics, and 
      transcriptomics were chosen to sequence the changes in gut microbiota, serum 
      metabolite levels, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leptin 
      receptor-deficient db/db mice and analyze the correlation between serum 
      metabolites and gut microbiota or DEGs. According to the results, there were 
      significant differences in the 1,029 cardiac genes and 353 serum metabolites in 
      diabetic mice of the db/db group, including DEGs enriched in the PPAR signaling 
      pathway and increased short-chain carboxylic acids (CAs), when compared with the 
      normal db/m group. According to metagenomics, the gut microbiota of mice in the 
      db/db group were disrupted, and particularly Lachnospiraceae bacteria and 
      Oscillospiraceae bacteria significantly decreased. Also, according to the Pearson 
      correlation analysis, a significant positive correlation was found between CAs 
      and PPAR signaling pathway-related DEGs, and a negative correlation was found 
      between CAs and the abundance of the above-mentioned species. To sum up, type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can upregulate the expression of partial cardiac genes 
      through the levels of serum short-chain CAs affected by gut microbiota, thus 
      playing a role in the occurrence and development of diabetic cardiomyopathy 
      (DCM). IMPORTANCE: Our research results clearly link the changes in heart genes 
      of T2DM and normal mice with changes in serum metabolites and gut microbiota, 
      indicating that some genes in biological processes are closely related to the 
      reduction of protective microbiota in the gut microbiota. This study provides a 
      theoretical basis for investigating the mechanism of DCM and may provide 
      preliminary evidence for the future use of gut microbiota therapy for DCM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use systems biology to explore the biomolecular network mechanism 
      of the Jiangtang Tiaozhi Recipe (JTTZR) in the intervention of obese Type 2 
      diabetes (T2DM) patients with dyslipidemia. METHODS: Twelve patients with obese 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (traditional Chinese medicine syndrome 
      differentiation was excess heat syndrome of the stomach and intestines) were 
      treated with JTTZR for 24 weeks, and 12 patients were included in the healthy 
      control group. First, blood samples from 6 patients in each group (disease group 
      before treatment, disease group after treatment, and healthy control group) were 
      collected for RNA microarray analysis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
      (qPCR) was used to validate these target lncRNAs and mRNAs. Finally, a detailed 
      analysis of the differences in the disease group before treatment vs. the healthy 
      control group and the disease group after treatment vs. the disease group before 
      treatment was undertaken. In addition, we focused on disease-related pathways and 
      analyzed the correlation between the differential expression of target lncRNAs 
      and clinical indicators. RESULTS: (1) Disease group before treatment vs. healthy 
      control group: There were 557 up-regulated lncRNAs, 273 down-regulated lncRNAs, 
      491 up-regulated mRNAs, and 1639 down-regulated mRNAs. GO analysis and pathway 
      analysis showed that T2DM may be related to cell proliferation in the forebrain, 
      post-embryonic organ development, calcium signaling pathway. qPCR validation 
      showed that the expression of XLOC-005590 and HNF1A-AS1 as target lncRNAs 
      increased, and this was verified by gene chip analysis. (2) Disease group after 
      treatment vs. disease group before treatment: 128 lncRNAs were upregulated, 32 
      lncRNAs were downregulated, 45 mRNAs were upregulated, and 140 mRNAs were 
      downregulated. GO analysis and pathway analysis showed that JTTZR may treat T2DM 
      through endosome transport, the insulin signaling pathway, and glycine, serine, 
      and threonine metabolism. qPCR validation showed that in the healthy control 
      group, XLOC_005590 was upregulated, whereas the downstream gene (ECI2) was 
      downregulated in the disease group before treatment. However, after 24 weeks of 
      intervention with JTTZR, XLOC_005590 was downregulated and ECI2 was upregulated 
      compared with the disease group before treatment (0 weeks) (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      JTTZR may interfere in patients with obese T2DM with dyslipidemia by regulating 
      pathways such as fatty acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate 
      metabolism.

      improves glycemic control in adult mice.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important posttranscriptional regulators of metabolism and 
      energy homeostasis. Dysregulation of certain miRNAs in the liver has been shown 
      to contribute to the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), in part by impairing 
      hepatic insulin sensitivity. By small RNA-sequencing analysis, we identified 
      seven hepatic miRNAs (including miR-29b) that are consistently aberrantly 
      expressed across five different rodent models of metabolic dysfunction that share 
      the feature of insulin resistance (IR). We also showed that hepatic miR-29b 
      exhibits persistent dysregulation during disease progression in a rat model of 
      diabetes, UCD-T2DM. Furthermore, we observed that hepatic levels of miR-29 family 
      members are attenuated by interventions known to improve IR in rodent and rhesus 
      macaque models. To examine the function of the miR-29 family in modulating 
      insulin sensitivity, we used locked nucleic acid (LNA) technology and 
      demonstrated that acute in vivo suppression of the miR-29 family in adult mice 
      leads to significant reduction of fasting blood glucose (in both chow-fed lean 
      and high-fat diet-fed obese mice) and improvement in insulin sensitivity (in 
      chow-fed lean mice). We carried out whole transcriptome studies and uncovered 
      candidate mechanisms, including regulation of DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) 
      and the hormone-encoding gene Energy homeostasis associated (Enho). In sum, we 
      showed that IR/T2D is linked to dysregulation of hepatic miR-29b across numerous 
      models and that acute suppression of the miR-29 family in adult mice leads to 
      improved glycemic control. Future studies should investigate the therapeutic 
      utility of miR-29 suppression in different metabolic disease states.Enho; insulin

TI  - miRNA Signature of Urine Extracellular Vesicles Shows the Involvement of 
      Inflammatory and Apoptotic Processes in Diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 817-832

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of urine-derived 
      extracellular vesicles (uEVs) in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients 
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: UEVs were characterized 
      by size distribution and microRNA content by next-generation small RNA sequencing 
      and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: A subset of sixteen miRNAs 
      enriched in T2DM patients with DKD, including hsa-miR-514a-5p, hsa-miR‑451a, 
      hsa-miR-126-3p, hsa-miR-214, or hsa-miR‑503 was identified. Eight miRNAs as 
      hsa-miR-21-3p, hsa-miR-4792, hsa-miR‑375, hsa-miR-1268a, hsa-miR-501-5p, or 
      hsa-miR-582 were downregulated. Prediction of potential target genes and pathway 
      enrichment analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      confirmed possible functions related to cellular processes such as apoptosis, 
      inflammation, and tissue remodeling, that promote diabetic complications, such as 
      DKD. Among them, hsa-miR-375, hsa-miR-503, and hsa-miR-451a make important 
      contribution. Additionally, downregulated hsa-miR-582-5p has not been reported so 
      far in any diabetes-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the most 
      significant miRNAs in uEVs of patients with T2DM. However, as this is a 
      bioinformatic prediction that we performed based on the putative targets of the 
      identified miRNAs. Thus, further in vitro functional studies are needed to 
      confirm our findings. Knowing the fact that EVs are crucial in transferring 
      miRNAs, there is a great need toto discover their involvement in the 
      pathomechanism of T2DM-related kidney disease.

TI  - Noninvasive fibrosis tools in NAFLD: validation of APRI, BARD, FIB-4, NAFLD 
      fibrosis score, and Hepamet fibrosis score in a Portuguese population.
PG  - 435-440
LID - 10.1080/00325481.2022.2058285 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing, 
      with an estimated prevalence in Europe of 20-30%. Although most patients present 
      with simple steatosis, some progress to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Definite diagnosis and staging require liver biopsy, 
      which is not feasible given the high prevalence of NAFLD. As such, several 
      noninvasive tools have been formulated. However, to date, none have been 
      validated in the Portuguese population. The aim of this study was to determine 
      the diagnostic accuracy of the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio 
      (APRI), the BMI, AST/ALT ratio and Diabetes (BARD), the FIB-4 Index (FIB-4), the 
      Hepamet fibrosis score (HFS), and the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) in a Portuguese 
      population. METHODS: A retrospective review of liver biopsies from two hospital 
      centers was performed. Patients with NAFLD and no decompensated cirrhosis, liver 
      cancer, or terminal illness were included. APRI, BARD, FIB-4, HFS, and NFS were 
      calculated for each patient. RESULTS: A total of 121 individuals were included, 
      of which 21.5% had advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3). There was a moderate or high 
      correlation between most tools. The negative predictive factor (NPV) and area 
      under receiver operating curve (AUROC) were 89.9% and 0.80 for APRI, 91.8% and 
      0.84 for BARD, 95.7% and 0.88 for FIB-4, 96.4% and 0.88 for HFS, and 93.0% and 
      0.86 for NFS, respectively. CONCLUSION: The tools analyzed had excellent 
      performance (AUROC ≥ 0.80) and were adequate for ruling out advanced fibrosis 
      (NPV ≥ 89.9%) in a Portuguese population. As such, they are adequate for use in 
      clinical practice or as a part of referral and follow-up programs wherever this 
      population is treated. ABBREVIATIONS: APRI - aspartate aminotransferase to

AB  - Harnessing the mechanisms underlying the exacerbated vascular remodeling in 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) is pivotal to prevent the high toll of vascular diseases 
      in patients with DM. miRNA regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) 
      phenotypic switch. However, miRNA modulation of the detrimental diabetic VSMC 
      phenotype is underexplored. Streptozotocin-induced type 1 DM (T1DM) Wistar rats 
      and type 2 DM (T2DM) Zucker rats underwent right carotid artery experimental 
      angioplasty, and global miRNA/mRNA expression profiling was obtained by RNA 
      sequencing (RNA-Seq). Two days after injury, a set of six miRNAs were found to be 
      uniquely downregulated or upregulated in VSMCs both in T1DM and T2DM. Among these 
      miRNAs, miR-29c and miR-204 were the most significantly misregulated in 
      atherosclerotic plaques from patients with DM. miR-29c overexpression and miR-204 
      inhibition per se attenuated VSMC phenotypic switch in DM. Concomitant miR-29c 
      overexpression and miR-204 inhibition fostered an additive reduction in VSMC 
      proliferation. Epithelial membrane protein 2 (Emp2) and Caveolin-1 (Cav1) mRNAs 
      were identified as direct targets of miR-29c and miR-204, respectively. 
      Importantly, contemporary miR-29c overexpression and miR-204 inhibition in the 
      injured artery robustly reduced arterial stenosis in DM rats. Thus, 
      contemporaneous miR-29c activation and miR-204 inhibition in DM arterial tissues 
      is necessary and sufficient to prevent the exaggerated VSMC growth upon injury.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most general post-transcriptional modification of 
      eukaryotic mRNAs and long-stranded non-coding RNAs. In this process, It has been 
      shown that FTO associates with the m6A mRNA demethylase and plays a role in 
      diabetic vascular endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, we detected FTO 
      protein expression in HUVECs by Western blot and found that FTO was highly 
      expressed in all disease groups relative to the control group. To explore the 
      mechanism of FTO in T2DM vasculopathy, we performed an analysis by methylated RNA 
      immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) to elucidate the role of aberrant m6A 
      modification and mRNA expression in endothelial dysfunction. The results showed 
      202 overlapping genes with varying m6A modifications and varied mRNA expression, 
      and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were predominantly 
      enriched in pathways associated with T2DM complications and endothelial 
      dysfunction. By an integrated analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq results, the IGV 
      plots showed elevated kurtosis of downstream candidate gene modifications, which 
      may be downstream targets for FTO to exercise biological functions. HOXA9 and 
      PLAU mRNA expression levels were significantly down after FTO inhibition. In the 
      current work, we set up a typological profile of the m6A genes among HUVECs as 
      well as uncovered a hidden relationship between RNA methylation modifications for 
      T2DM vasculopathy-associated genes. Taken together, this study indicates that 
      endothelial functional impairment is present in T2DM patients and may be related 
      to aberrant expression of FTO.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obese patients are at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). A lipid-rich diet promotes arterial 
      changes by inducing hypertension, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Bromodomain 
      and extraterminal (BET) proteins contribute to endothelial and immune cell 
      activation in vitro and in atherosclerosis mouse models. We aim to determine if 
      BET inhibition can reduce lipid-rich diet-induced vascular inflammation in mice. 
      METHODS: Body weight, serum glucose and lipid levels were measured in mice fed a 
      high-fat diet (HFD) or low-fat diet (LFD) for 6 weeks and at study termination. 
      BET inhibitors apabetalone and JQ1 were co-administered with the HFD for 
      additional 16 weeks. Aortic gene expression was analyzed post necropsy by PCR, 
      Nanostring nCounter® Inflammation Panel and bioinformatics pathway analysis. 
      Transcription changes and BRD4 chromatin occupancy were analyzed in primary human 
      endothelial cells in response to TNFα and apabetalone. RESULTS: HFD induced 
      weight gain, visceral obesity, high fasting blood glucose, glucose intolerance 
      and insulin resistance compared to LFD controls. HFD upregulated the aortic 
      expression of 47 genes involved in inflammation, innate immunity, cytoskeleton 
      and complement pathways. Apabetalone and JQ1 treatment reduced HFD-induced aortic 
      expression of proinflammatory genes. Congruently, bioinformatics predicted 
      enhanced signaling by TNFα in the HFD versus LFD aorta, which was countered by 
      BETi treatment. TNFα-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased expression 
      of HFD-sensitive genes and higher BRD4 chromatin occupancy, which was countered 
      by apabetalone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: HFD induces vascular inflammation in mice 
      through TNFα signaling. Apabetalone treatment reduces this proinflammatory 
      phenotype, providing mechanistic insight into how BET inhibitors may reduce CVD 
      risk in obese patients.

TI  - Long Non-Coding RNA LINC01572 Promotes Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression via

AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and T2DM-associated HCC 
      represents a common type of HCC cases. We herein identify an lncRNA LINC01572 
      that was aberrantly upregulated in T2DM-related HCC via high-throughput 
      screening. Based on this, the study was undertaken to identify the functional 
      role and mechanism of LINC01572 in HCC progression. Methods: RT-qPCR was used to 
      detect the expressions of LINC01572 in HCC tissues and cell lines. Gain- or 
      loss-of-function assays were applied to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo 
      functional significance of LINC01572 in the HCC cell proliferation, migration, 
      and invasion using corresponding experiments. Bioinformatics, RIP, RNA pull-down, 
      and luciferase reporter assays were performed to explore the regulatory 
      relationship of the LINC01572/miR-195-5p/PFKFB4 signaling axis. Result: In this 
      study, we profiled lncRNAs in HCC tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues from 
      HCC patients with T2DM by RNA sequencing. Our data showed that LINC01572 was 
      aberrantly upregulated in HCC tissues as compared with control, especially in 
      those with concurrent T2DM. The high level of LINC01572 was correlated with 
      advanced tumor stage, increased blood HbA1c level, and shortened survival time. 
      The overexpression of LINC01572 significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation, 
      migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while the 
      knockdown of LINC01572 had the opposite effects on HCC cells. A mechanistic study 
      revealed that LINC01572-regulated HCC progression via sponging miR-195-5p to 
      increase the level of PFKFB4 and subsequent enhancement of glycolysis and 
      activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. Conclusion: LINC01572 acts as ceRNA of 
      miR-195-5p to restrict its inhibition of PFKFB4, thereby enhancing glycolysis and 
      activates PI3K/AKT signaling to trigger HCC malignancy.

TI  - Negative pressure wound therapy in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers may be 
      mediated through differential gene expression.
PG  - 115-120
LID - 10.1007/s00592-018-1223-y [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been successfully used as a 
      treatment for diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). Its mechanism of action on the 
      molecular level, however, is not fully understood. We assessed the effect of NPWT 
      on gene expression in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and DFU. METHODS: We 
      included two cohorts of patients-individuals treated with either NPWT or standard 
      therapy. The assignment to NWPT was non-randomized and based on wound 
      characteristics. Differential gene expression profiling was performed using 
      Illumina gene expression arrays and R Bioconductor pipelines based on the 'limma' 
      package. RESULTS: The final cohort encompassed 21 patients treated with NPWT and 
      8 with standard therapy. The groups were similar in terms of age (69.0 versus 
      67.5 years) and duration of T2DM (14.5 versus 14.4 years). We identified four 
      genes differentially expressed between the two study arms post-treatment, but not 
      pre-treatment: GFRA2 (GDNF family receptor alpha-2), C1QBP (complement C1q 
      binding protein), RAB35 (member of RAS oncogene family) and SYNJ1 (synaptic 
      inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1). Interestingly, all four genes 
      seemed to be functionally involved in wound healing by influencing 
      re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. Subsequently, we utilized co-expression 
      analysis in publicly available RNA-seq data to reveal the molecular functions of 
      GFRA2 and C1QBP, which appeared to be through direct protein-protein 
      interactions. CONCLUSIONS: We found initial evidence that the NPWT effect on DFUs 
      may be mediated through differential gene expression. A discovery of the specific 
      molecular mechanisms of NPWT is potentially valuable for its clinical application 
      and development of new therapies.

AB  - It is well-accepted that the liver plays a vital role in the metabolism of 
      glucose and its homeostasis. Dysregulated hepatic glucose production and 
      utilization, leads to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In the current study, RNA 
      sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis of nanoformulation-treated T2DM mice (TG(thr) 
      group) revealed beneficial crosstalk of PCK-1 silencing with other pathways 
      involved in T2DM. The comparison of precise genetic expression profiles of the 
      different experimental groups showed significantly improved hepatic glucose, 
      fatty acid metabolism and several other T2DM-associated crucial markers after the 
      nanoformulation treatment. As a result of these improvements, we observed a 
      significant acceleration in wound healing and improved insulin signaling in 
      vascular endothelial cells in the TG(thr) group as compared to the T2DM group. 
      Enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt pathway proteins in the TG(thr) group 
      resulted in increased angiogenesis as observed by the increased expression of 
      endothelial cell markers (CD31, CD34) thereby improving endothelial dysfunctions 
      in the TG(thr) group. Additionally, therapeutic nanoformulation has been observed 
      to improve the inflammatory cytokine profile in the TG(thr) group. Overall, our 
      results demonstrated that the synthesized therapeutic nanoformulation referred to 
      as GPR8:PCK-1(siRNA) holds the potential in ameliorating hyperglycemia-associated 
      complications such as delayed wound healing in diabetes.

TI  - Hepatic transcriptome implications for palm fruit juice deterrence of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus in young male Nile rats.
PG  - 29
LID - 29
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Nile rat (NR, Arvicanthis niloticus) is a model of 
      carbohydrate-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the metabolic syndrome. 
      A previous study found that palm fruit juice (PFJ) delayed or prevented diabetes 
      and in some cases even reversed its early stages in young NRs. However, the 
      molecular mechanisms by which PFJ exerts these anti-diabetic effects are unknown. 
      In this study, the transcriptomic effects of PFJ were studied in young male NRs, 
      using microarray gene expression analysis. METHODS: Three-week-old weanling NRs 
      were fed either a high-carbohydrate diet (%En from 
      carbohydrate/fat/protein = 70:10:20, 16.7 kJ/g; n = 8) or the same 
      high-carbohydrate diet supplemented with PFJ (415 ml of 13,000-ppm gallic acid 
      equivalent (GAE) for a final concentration of 5.4 g GAE per kg diet or 2.7 g per 
      2000 kcal; n = 8). Livers were obtained from these NRs for microarray gene 
      expression analysis using Illumina MouseRef-8 Version 2 Expression BeadChips. 
      Microarray data were analysed along with the physiological parameters of 
      diabetes. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, 71 genes were up-regulated 
      while 108 were down-regulated in the group supplemented with PFJ. Among hepatic 
      genes up-regulated were apolipoproteins related to high-density lipoproteins 
      (HDL) and genes involved in hepatic detoxification, while those down-regulated 
      were related to insulin signalling and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: The results obtained 
      suggest that the anti-diabetic effects of PFJ may be due to mechanisms other than 
      an increase in insulin secretion.

AB  - AIMS: We conducted this study with two aims: (1) whether TRβ could be damaged by 
      NAFLD, thereby represent thyroid hormone resistance-like manifestation and (2) to 
      analyze the potential role of SPP1 in TH signaling pathway on the process of 
      NAFLD. This study is expected to provide a new perspective on the therapeutic 
      mechanism in the pathological course of NAFLD. METHODS: A total of 166 patients 
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were enrolled in this study. All 
      patients had a BMI above 24 kg/m2 and were stratified into two groups: NAFLD and 
      Non-NAFLD groups. Ages, gender, BMI, duration of diabetes and biochemical markers 
      were obtained from participants' records. We downloaded the dataset GSE48452 from 
      GEO. The Pathview library was used to make the thyroid hormone signaling pathway 
      visualization. The CIBERSORT algorithm was applied to calculate the infiltrated 
      immune cells in obese NAFLD patients. C57BL/6 mice were randomly selected to 
      constitute the normal control (NC) group and were fed a normal chow diet; the 
      rest of the mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD). After 12 weeks HFD feeding, the 
      mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and blood samples were collected. 
      Mouse livers were also collected; one part of each liver was fixed in 10% 
      formalin for histological analysis, and the other part was snap-frozen for 
      subsequent molecular analyses. To explore the relationship between SPP1, TRβ and 
      lipid deposition in hepatocytes, HepG2 cells were treated with 50 μ M 
      concentration of PA and/or 20 ng/ml concentration of rh-SPP1 for 48h. In 
      addition, the PC3.1-TRβ plasmid was constructed for further validation in HepG2 
      cells. We used THP-1 cells to construct an M1 macrophage model in vitro. We then 
      analyzed THP-1 cells treated with various concentrations of PA or TSH. RESULTS: 
      (1) After adjusting for all factors that appeared P value less than 0.1 in the 
      univariate analysis, BMI, TSH, and FT3 were significant independent risk factors 
      of NAFLD (ORs were 1.218, 1.694, and 2.259, respectively); (2) A further analysis 
      with BMI stratification indiacted that both FT3 and TSH had a significant change 
      between individuals with NAFLD and Non-NAFLD in obesity subgroup; however, there 
      was no statistic difference in over-weight group; (3) Bioinformatics analysis of 
      GSE48452 had shown that several key molecular (including TRβ) of thyroid hormone 
      pathway affected by NAFLD induced transcriptomic changes and the expression 
      levels of SPP1, FABP4 and RPS4Y1 were significantly higher, while the expression 
      levels of PZP and VIL1 were significantly decreased in NAFLD patients(adjusted p 
      < 0.05, |logFC| > 1.0). The CIBERSORT algorithm showed increased M0 and M1, 
      decreased M2 macrophage infiltration in NAFLD with comparison to healthy obese 
      group; (4) After 12 weeks of HFD-feeding, the obesity mice had significantly 
      higher serum TSH and In IHC-stained liver sections of obesity group, the 
      intensity of SPP1 had a significantly increased, while TRβ reduced; (5) In vitro 
      studies have shown SPP1 aggravated lipid deposition in hepatic cells dependent on 
      down-regulating the expression of TRβ and TSH acts to promote secretion of SPP1 
      in M1 macrophage cells. CONCLUSIONS: SPP1 secretion induced by M1 macrophage 
      polarization, which may down-regulates TRβ in hepatocytes via paracrine manner, 
      on the one hand, the lipid deposition aggravating in liver, on the other hand, a 
      compensatory increase of TSH in serum. The increased TSH can further lead to the 
      following SPP1 secretion of M1 macrophage. The positive feedback crosstalk 
      between thyroid and liver, may be plays an important role in maintaining and 
      amplifying pathological process of NAFLD.

TI  - Mendelian Randomization and Transcriptome Data Analysis Reveal Bidirectional 
      Causal Relationships and Mechanisms Between Type 2 Diabetes and Gastric Cancer.
LID - 10.2174/0109298673348645241226091059 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer globally, and 
      the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cancer risk remains 
      controversial. METHODS: We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using 
      publicly available GWAS data to assess the causal relationship between T2DM and 
      GC, validated by heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses. Transcriptomic data from 
      TCGA and GEO were analyzed to identify common differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs). Weighted gene co-- expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
      construct a prognostic risk model. Drug sensitivity and immune infiltration were 
      evaluated using GDSC and ImmuCellAI, respectively. Additionally, gene mutation 
      analysis was conducted using TCGA data. RESULTS: The Mendelian randomization 
      analysis revealed a causal relationship between T2DM and GC at the genetic level. 
      Specifically, the causal effect of T2DM on GC was estimated with an odds ratio 
      (OR) of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.12-1.56), while the reverse causal effect of GC on T2DM 
      was estimated at an OR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67-0.91). Sensitivity analyses, 
      including Cochran's Q test and the leave-one-out test, confirmed the robustness 
      of these findings. We constructed a prognostic risk score consisting of three 
      T2DM-related genes (CST2, PSAPL1, and C4orf48) based on transcriptome data 
      analysis. Patients with high-risk scores exhibited significantly worse overall 
      survival (OS) (p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis further confirmed the 
      independent predictive value of the risk score for GC prognosis. Our predictive 
      model demonstrated good performance, with an AUC of 0.786 in the training set and 
      0.757 in the validation set. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that the genes 
      shared between T2DM and GC were associated with inflammatory response, immune 
      response, and metabolic pathways. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis 
      suggested that immune evasion mechanisms may play a key role in developing GC in 
      patients with coexisting T2DM. CONCLUSION: T2DM is associated with reduced GC 
      risk. The risk score and model may help guide GC prognosis and management.

      promotes adipocytes inflammation by suppressing Nrf2 expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized 
      by insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. Adipose tissue macrophages 
      (ATMs), central players in mediating pro-inflammatory responses within adipose 
      tissue, have been shown to influence insulin sensitivity through exosome 
      secretion. While the role of macrophages-derived exosomal miRNA has been studied 
      in various diseases, their pathogenic roles in T2DM, particularly ATMs-derived 
      exosomal miRNA in adipose tissue inflammation, remain underexplored. OBJECTIVES: 
      This study focuses specifically on T2DM, investigating the role of ATM-derived 
      exosomal miRNAs in adipose tissue inflammation, a critical factor in the 
      pathogenesis of T2DM. METHODS: ATM were isolated from visceral adipose tissues in 
      patients with or without diabetes. Differentially expressed miRNAs in ATM-derived 
      exosomes were predicted by high-throughput RNA sequencing. The RAW264.7 
      macrophages and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was selected as a model system. Quantitative 
      RT-PCR was used to assess miR-500a-5p expression. The direct binding of 
      miR-500a-5p to Nrf2 mRNA 3' UTR was verified by dual luciferase assay. RESULTS: 
      MiR-500a-5p was also enriched in the exosomes of high-glucose-treated 
      macrophages. Furthermore, these exosomes induced high expression of miR-500a-5p 
      and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipocytes when co-cultured with 
      them. Additionally, the reduction of miR-500a-5p expression in macrophages by 
      using a miR-500a-5p inhibitor ameliorated the pro-inflammatory properties of the 
      exosomes, and co-culturing these exosomes with adipocytes resulted in decreased 
      expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins in adipocytes. In contrast, 
      induction of miR-500a-5p expression led to the opposite results. Moreover, the 
      dual-luciferase assay confirmed that miR-500a-5p directly targeted the 3' UTR of 
      Nrf2 mRNA. Unlike miR-500a-5p, Nrf2 exhibited an anti-inflammatory response. 
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that ATM-derived exosomal miR-500a-5p promotes 
      NLRP3 inflammasome activation and adipose tissue inflammation through 
      down-regulation of Nrf2 in adipocytes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a health issue affecting millions of people 
      worldwide. Prolonged hyperglycemia increases the risk of pathological fractures; 
      however, verifying this risk through bone analysis is challenging because of the 
      heterogeneity of bone. METHODS: The systemic effects of type 2 DM (T2DM) on 
      calcified tissues were investigated by examining dentin in mice, focusing on the 
      underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Mouse incisor dentin was selected 
      because of its continuous growth, similar to the annual rings of wood, offering a 
      unique opportunity to study the time-dependent deterioration of calcified tissue 
      affected by T2DM. RNA sequencing of pulp-derived cells was used to identify 
      transcriptomic alterations in a db/db mouse model (BKS.cg-Lepr[db]/Lepr[db]Jc). 
      Structural and mechanical changes in dentin were evaluated using Raman 
      spectroscopy and nanoindentation. RESULTS: There was an increase in dentin volume 
      in diabetic mice, accompanied by a deterioration in mechanical properties, 
      particularly in primary dentin. This mechanical deterioration is likely to be 
      associated with an inflammation-driven formation of abnormal dentin matrix caused 
      by long-term hyperglycemia. No significant differences were observed in 
      cross-linked collagen structures or advanced glycation end products. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The findings demonstrated that gene expression in T2DM affects dentin and bone, 
      contributing to micro-structural fragility through protein production. The 
      incisor model used in this study proved to be a versatile tool for assessing 
      other diseases that affect the integrity of calcified tissues over time.

TI  - A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6, ω3) Mediated Attenuation of 
      Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male Ldlr (-/-) Mice.
LID - 10.3390/metabo9110252 [doi]
LID - 252
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem 
      worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). 
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, 
      and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of 
      these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify 
      potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical 
      mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse, Ldlr (-/-)) model to assess 
      transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid 
      (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the 
      previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled 
      with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid 
      chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to 
      assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin 
      composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and 
      monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane 
      lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids 
      and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA 
      lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and 
      significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as 
      well as C(20-22) ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and 
      fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C(20-22) ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- 
      and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted 
      p-value; q ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial 
      remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic 
      pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic 
      anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C(20-22) ω3 PUFA.

TI  - Leptin Receptor Deficiency-Associated Diabetes Disrupts Lacrimal Gland Circadian 
      Rhythms and Contributes to Dry Eye Syndrome.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the impact of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) on the circadian rhythms and function of lacrimal glands (LGs) in 
      contributing to dry eye syndrome. We assessed the effects of hyperglycemia on 
      circadian gene expression, immune cell recruitment, neural activity, and 
      metabolic pathways, and evaluated the effectiveness of insulin in restoring 
      normal LG function. METHODS: Using a T2DM mouse model (db/db mice), circadian 
      transcriptomic changes in LGs were analyzed through RNA sequencing over a 24-hour 
      period. Rhythmic expression of core clock genes, immune and neural activity, and 
      metabolic pathways were evaluated. The effects of insulin treatment on these 
      parameters were also assessed. RESULTS: Hyperglycemia disrupted the circadian 
      expression of core clock genes in LGs, leading to a 50% reduction in rhythmic 
      gene expression. This was associated with altered immune cell recruitment, 
      impaired neural activity, and metabolic changes. Insulin treatment lowered blood 
      glucose levels but did not restore normal circadian function or tear secretion, 
      exacerbating dry eye syndrome in diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM significantly 
      disrupts circadian rhythms and function in lacrimal glands, contributing to dry 
      eye syndrome. The limited efficacy of insulin in restoring circadian regulation 
      suggests that hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction in LGs is not solely dependent on 
      blood glucose levels, highlighting the need for therapies targeting circadian 
      rhythms in diabetic ocular complications.
