AB  - Immunoblots remain the gold standard for HIV-1/HIV-2 infection confirmation. 
      However, their ability to differentiate HIV-1 from HIV-2 infection on an 
      antigenically diversified HIV-1 and HIV-2 panel remain uncommon. We performed a 
      multicenter study on 116 serum samples accounting for most of the diversity of 
      HIV-1 (9 different subtypes in group M, 17 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), 
      and 3 group O) and HIV-2 (groups A and B), evaluating seven confirmatory assays 
      (six commercially available assays and one in-house assay) with genotyping as the 
      reference. The assays were INNO-LIA HIV I/II score, HIV-2 blot 1.2, HIV blot 2.2, 
      New Lav blot I and II, Geenius, and an in-house serotyping enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among the HIV-1 samples, INNO-LIA, HIV blot 2.2, New 
      Lav blot I, Geenius, and serotyping had comparable high sensitivities, from 98% 
      to 100%, whereas HIV-2 blot 1.2 and New Lav blot II had high rates of 
      "undetermined" results (85% and 95%, respectively). HIV-2 blot 1.2 and New Lav 
      blot II misclassified 7% and 5% of HIV-1 samples as HIV-2, respectively, and 
      HIV-2 blot 1.2 had an 8% false-negative rate. Among the HIV-2 samples, INNO-LIA, 
      New Lav blot II, HIV-2 blot 1.2, and serotyping had high sensitivities, from 96% 
      to 100%. HIV blot 2.2 misclassified 17% of HIV-2 samples as HIV-1/HIV-2 dual 
      infections. New Lav blot I misclassified 19% of HIV-2 samples as HIV-1 with a 
      high (81%) undetermined rate, and Geenius misclassified 2% as HIV-1 and 7% as 
      untypeable HIV positive. For HIV-1/HIV-2 dual infection, the results were less 
      sensitive, with at most 87.5% for INNO-LIA and Geenius and 75% for HIV blot 2.2 
      and serotyping. Overall, confirmatory assays remain useful for most cases, with 
      the exception of HIV-1/HIV-2 dual-infection suspicion.

TI  - HIV‑2 antibody detection after indeterminate or negative HIV‑1 Western blot in 
      Cuba, 2005-2008.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Differentiating between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection is the first step 
      to understanding HIV transmission, epidemiology and pathogenesis in geographical 
      areas where both viruses circulate. In Cuba, positive results in mixed HIV-1/2 
      screening assays are confirmed by HIV-1 Western blot. Indeterminate results 
      constitute the main limitation of this test and HIV-2 infection is among their 
      possible causes; hence the importance of second-stage screening and confirmatory 
      tests for HIV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE Investigate the contribution of HIV-2 
      antibodies to negative or indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot results in serum 
      samples from 2005 through 2008 in Cuba. METHODS HIV-2 reactivity was studied 
      using the ELISA DAVIH-VIH-2 diagnostic kit (Cuba) in 1723 serum samples with 
      negative or indeterminate results for HIV-1 Western blot from January 2005 
      through December 2008. Duplicate sera reactive by ELISA were confirmed by HIV-2 
      Western blot, results interpreted according to WHO criteria. The epidemiological 
      interview established by Cuba's National Program for Prevention and Control 
      Sexually-Transmitted Diseases and HIV/AIDS was applied to HIV-2 Western 
      blot-positive patients. RESULTS Among all sera studied, HIV-2 ELISA identified 12 
      reactive serum samples (0.70%) and 1711 non-reactive (99.30%). Western blot 
      analysis of the 12 ELISA-reactive samples confirmed two positive samples 
      (16.67%), 4 negative (33.33%) and 6 indeterminate (50%). Positive samples reacted 
      against the p16, p26, gp36, p53, p56, p68 and gp105 proteins. All 12 
      ELISA-reactive samples belonged to the HIV-1 Western blot indeterminate group. 
      The two HIV-2-positive samples showed well defined reactivity to gp160, p53, p55 
      and p34 of HIV-1. HIV-1 seroconversion was observed in all 10 remaining samples 
      during serological followup. CONCLUSIONS Two new HIV-2 seropositive cases were 
      diagnosed using DAVIH-VIH-2 and HIV-2 Western blot in indeterminate HIV-1 Western 
      blot samples. Results support the recommendation that HIV-2 Western blot be 
      included in the diagnostic algorithm for HIV-1/2 to followup negative or 
      indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot results. KEYWORDS Diagnosis, laboratory

AB  - Recently, immunoblots (IBs) have tended to substitute Western blots (WBs) for HIV 
      infection diagnosis. Several studies have confirmed IBs' high sensitivity to 
      confirm HIV infection for every stage. Since the nature and pattern of the 
      antigens of IBs are different from those of WB, the abilities of IBs and WBs to 
      distinguish the stages of recent seroconversion and open-ended chronic infection 
      might differ. We aimed to evaluate the performance of two IBs (INNO-LIA™ HIVI/II, 
      Fujirebio, and Geenius™ HIV1/2 Confirmatory assay, Bio-Rad) to define the stage 
      of infection. We studied 53 patients from the French ANRS CO6 PRIMO cohort. IBs 
      have higher positive rates than WB. However, Geenius was less sensitive than WB 
      and INNO-LIA to detect antibodies to p31 (0% vs 22.6 % and 15.1 %, respectively), 
      so it could wrongly label late Fiebig stage and open-ended chronic infections as 
      recent infections (n = 5/53). For the first time, we provide evidence that 
      centralized WBs associated with an enzyme immunoassay for the identification of 
      recent HIV-1 infection support the establishment of a more accurate diagnosis of 
      primary HIV infection to improve the accuracy of enrollments in cohorts of recent 
      HIV infections useful for epidemiological studies, pathogenesis studies or 
      therapeutic trials.

PG  - 59-61
AB  - A total of 466 repeatedly reactive HIV-1 blood samples evidenced by enzyme 
      immunoassay were analyzed by the Western blot method and interpreted according to 
      WHO and CDC criteria. Discordant and indeterminate samples were further analyzed 
      by PCR. When the Western blot result was classified as indeterminate, according 
      to both WHO and CDC criteria, the PCR test was always negative. These findings 
      suggest that samples with double-indeterminate status should be reported as 
      negative.

AB  - The IgG anti-Toxoplasma western blot technique was used in 25 HIV-cases and 8 
      control sera from patients without HIV infection aimed at evaluating the humoral 
      response in these patients. They were divided into 3 groups: 14 HIV positive 
      cases with cerebral toxoplasmosis and IgG anti-Toxoplasma serological titers, 11 
      HIV positive cases without cerebral toxoplasmosis and with IgG anti-Toxoplasma 
      titers, and 8 HIV negative patients with IgG anti-Toxoplasma titers. It was found 
      that the higher the IgG anti-Toxoplasma serum titers are, the greater the number 
      of bands in the western-blot is. The intensity of the bands measured by 
      densitometry varied significantly for proteins of 66 and 31 kDa. According to the 
      results, these proteins are of interest to evaluate their role in the 
      reactivation of toxoplasmosis in HIV patients.

PG  - 10
LID - 10.1007/s00430-024-00792-1 [doi]
AB  - Rapid tests allow outpatient, low cost, reliable, screening for chronic HIV 
      infection. However, data regarding their sensitivity on primary infection remain 
      scarce. The objective of this study was to assess sensitivity of nine HIV rapid 
      tests for primary HIV-1 infection screening. Seventy-five serum samples from 
      patients during HIV-1 primary infection were included. Primary infection was 
      diagnosed by a positive 4th generation ELISA and HIV-1 RNA positivity confirmed 
      by Western blot patterns associated with HIV-1 primary infection. Early 
      seroconversion was defined as the absence of antibodies on HIV-1 Western blot 
      associated with HIV-1 RNA and p24-antigen positivity. An identical sensitivity 
      (95% CI) of 76.7% (65.2-84.2%) was observed for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK(®) Assay 
      (STAT-PAK), INSTI™ HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody Test (INSTI), SURE CHECK(®) HIV 1/2 (SURE 
      CHECK) and MULTISURE HIV rapid test (MULTISURE) with visual reading. Sensitivity 
      was 74.7% (63.8-83.1%) for MULTISURE (automatic reading), 77.0% (66.3-85.1%) for 
      FIRST RESPONSE(®) Test VIH 1-2.O CARTE (FIRST RESPONSE), 83.8% (73.8-90.5%) for 
      VIKIA HIV1/2(®) (VIKIA), 88.0% (78.7-93.6%) for Genie™ Fast HIV 1/2 (Genie Fast), 
      88.6% (79.0-94.1%) for Hexagon HIV (Hexagon), and 92.8% (83.6-96.3%) for 
      Exacto(®) TEST HIV Pro (Exacto). However, rapid tests performed poorly for the 
      early seroconversion subgroup (n = 14), with sensitivities ranging from 7% 
      (1.3-31.5%) for STAT-PAK, INSTI, SURE CHECK, MULTISURE (automatic reading), to 
      29% (12-55%) for FIRST RESPONSE, 31% (13-58%) for VIKIA, 43% (21-67%) for Hexagon 
      and 57.1% (32.6-78.6%) for Exacto and Genie Fast. Overall, despite significant 
      discrepancies in sensitivity, HIV rapid tests should be used with caution in the 
      context of a suspected primary infection.

AB  - To determine the prevalence of HIV infection among stroke patients admitted to 
      the Douala General Hospital (DGH) and to describe the clinical characteristics 
      and outcome of the stroke patients with HIV infection. This prospective cohort 
      study took place in 2010-2015 at the DGH. The study included patients older than 
      15 years with a CT-confirmed stroke. All patients underwent HIV tests with 
      Western-Blot confirmation. The functional prognosis of the patients was assessed 
      by the Rankin score at 6 months after stroke onset. The prevalence rate of HIV 
      among stroke patients was 6.6% (40/608). Of the 40 HIV-positive patients, 58% 
      were aware of their status at admission; 83% of these patients were receiving 
      antiretroviral therapy. Males were predominant (65%), and the mean age was 51.3 ± 
      10.4 years. Hypertension was the main cerebrovascular risk factor (65%). At 
      admission, 47.5% of HIV+ patients were febrile, and 7.5% presented with coma. 
      Ischemic stroke accounted for 60% of cases. The mean CD4 cell count was 351 ± 
      236/mm(3) with a median of 330/mm(3). The length of stay was 10 ± 8 days. At 6 
      months, the cumulative mortality of HIV+ patients was 37.5%, and 38.5% were 
      dependent (Rankin>2). HIV prevalence is high among stroke patients in our 
      setting. This suggests that an HIV test should be routinely proposed to stroke 
      patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) co-infection occur in many populations. People 
      living with HIV-1 and infected with HTLV-1 seem more likely to progress rapidly 
      towards AIDS. Both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 are endemic in Gabon (Central Africa). We 
      investigated HTLV-1 and HIV-1 co-infection in the Haut-Ogooué province, and 
      assessed factors that may favor the rapid evolution and progression to AIDS in 
      co-infected patients. METHODS: Plasma samples from HTLV-1 patients were tested 
      using ELISA, and positive samples were then tested by western blot assay (WB). We 
      used the polymerase chain reaction to detect HTLV-1 Tax/Rex genes using DNA 
      extracted from the buffy coat of ELISA-positives samples. RESULTS: We recruited 
      299 individuals (mean age 46 years) including 90 (30%) men and 209 (70%) women, 
      all of whom are under treatment at the Ambulatory Treatment Centre of the 
      province. Of these, 45 were ELISA HTLV-1/2 seropositive. According to WB 
      criteria, 21 of 45 were confirmed positive: 20 were HTLV-1 (44%), 1 was HTLV-1/2 
      (2%), 2 were indeterminate (4%) and 22 were seronegative (49%). PCR results 
      showed that 23 individuals were positive for the Tax/Rex region. Considering both 
      serological and molecular assays, the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was 
      estimated at 7.7%. Being a woman and increasing age were found to be independent 
      risk factors for co-infection. Mean CD4+ cell counts were higher in HTLV-1/HIV-1 
      co-infected (578.1 (± 340.8) cells/mm3) than in HIV-1 mono-infected (481.0 (± 
      299.0) cells/mm3) Individuals. Similarly, the mean HIV-1 viral load was Log 3.0 
      (± 1.6) copies/ml in mono-infected and Log 2.3 (± 0.7) copies/ml in coinfected 
      individuals. CONCLUSION: We described an overall high prevalence of HTLV-1/HIV-1 
      co-infection in Gabon. Our findings stress the need of strategies to prevent and 
      manage these co-infections.

AB  - It is reported the evaluation of the DAVIH-BLOT system (DAVIH Laboratories, Cuba) 
      against the proficiency panels sent to the National AIDS Reference Laboratory by 
      the World Health Organization (WHO) in order to ensure the quality in the 
      diagnosis of HIV antibodies during 1989, 1991 and 1993. The system is also 
      compared with those of the Dupont and Diagnostic Pasteur firms in a group of 467 
      positive sera by ELISA. On studying the WHO's samples, the system proved to be 
      highly sensitive and specific. In the comparison made with the HIV-1 Western Blot 
      IgG version 1.2 (Dupont company, USA) and with the LAV-blot 1 (Diagnostic 
      Pasteur, France), there was a coincidence of 100 and 97%, respectively.

AB  - According the WHO there are about 14,000 new HIV infections a day. However, in a 
      few cases the diagnosis will be made in the acute phase of the disease. Acute HIV 
      infection is the period between infection with the virus and complete 
      seroconversion, defined by a positive Western blot test. This period lasts 
      approximately 30 days and most patients (40-90%) have mild clinical 
      manifestations (fever, rash, pharyngitis, mucosal ulcers, among others) for 2 
      weeks which, because they are nonspecific, can be confused with other 
      community-acquired infections. Microbiological diagnosis is based on the absence 
      of serum antibodies (negative ELISA test) together with a positive HIV viral load 
      in plasma (> 10,000 copies/ml). Diagnosis of acute HIV infection is important for 
      several reasons: firstly, from the epidemiological point of view, this is the 
      period with the highest rates of HIV transmission and identification of new HIV 
      infections reveals the growth of the epidemic and the transmission rates of 
      resistant HIV strains, which in Spain is about 10%; secondly, from the 
      immunopathological point of view, this period provides a unique opportunity to 
      study the virological, immunological and genetic mechanisms that play a role in 
      the transmission and pathogenesis of this disease; and thirdly, therapeutically, 
      starting antiretroviral therapy during this phase could alter the natural history 
      of the disease. However, this is a controversial issue and currently most 
      guidelines recommend treatment only if these patients can be included in clinical 
      trials or if they show lasting or severe clinical manifestations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are different confirmatory methods approved by standard 253 to 
      detect HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection, such as: Western blot, Immunofluorescence, 
      Recombinant immunoassay, among others. OBJECTIVE: Compare the concordance of 
      recombinant immunoassay (GeniusTM) versus Western blot (WB) tests for 
      confirmatory analysis of HIV-reactive samples in donors at the Blood Bank. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples that repeatedly showed reactivity for HIV during 
      chemiluminescence screening were analyzed. Confirmatory tests were applied by 
      Western Blot and Recombinant Immunoassay (GeniusTM). A double-blind study was 
      carried out using 39 reactive and 41 non-reactive samples by HIV serology. The 
      results were submitted to Diagnostic agreement. RESULTS: When analyzed with WB, 
      the 39 samples with a reactive result gave a positive result and of the 41 
      samples with a non-reactive result, 35 were found to have negative results and 6 
      were indeterminate. When analyzed with GeniusTM, the 39 samples with reactive 
      results gave positive results and the 41 non-reactive samples gave negative 
      results. The Kappa index obtained was 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that there 
      is a high agreement between the two methods and that both are reliable as tests 
      for confirmatory analysis of HIV in the Blood Bank, however, for practicality the 
      GeniusTM method offers more advantages.

      Depending on the Confirmatory Assay.
PG  - ofaa140

LID - ofaa140
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of HIV infection at the early stage is valuable for 
      patient management, for prevention, and for research purposes. In practice, 
      identification of a recent HIV infection at diagnosis proves challenging after 
      HIV antibody seroconversion but can be suspected using Western blots (WBs) or 
      immunoblots (IBs) as confirmatory assays. METHODS: Five commercially available 
      confirmatory assays were compared using 43 samples from recently infected 
      individuals. This included 2 WBs (New LAV Blot I, Biorad, and HIV Blot 2.2, MP 
      Biomedicals), 2 IBs (INNO-LIA HIV I/II, Fujirebio, and RecomLine HIV-1 & HIV-2, 
      Mikrogen Diagnostik), and 1 immunochromatographic single-use assay (Geenius 
      HIV1/2 supplemental assay, Biorad). RESULTS: Following the manufacturer's 
      recommendations for interpretation, the 2 WBs led to indeterminate results for 
      30% and 42% of the samples, suggesting recent infection, compared with 2%-7% for 
      the 3 other assays. When interpreted based on the Fiebig classification, 
      concordant stages were observed in 42% of samples, and only 49% were classified 
      as early seroconversion by all 5 assays. For the remaining specimens, the 
      distinction with chronic infection was highly variable depending on the assay 
      (5%-100%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical laboratories must consider this variability, 
      which must be kept in mind both for initial diagnosis and for multicenter studies 
      for which inclusion criteria refer to serological profiles by confirmatory 
      assays.

TI  - Exogenous Expression of WNT7A in Leukemia-Derived Cell Lines Induces Resistance 
      to Chemotherapeutic Agents.
PG  - 1504-1514
LID - 10.2174/1871520620666200521114100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulations of the WNT pathway are implicated in the malignant 
      transformation of different types of neoplasia. WNT7A is expressed in normal 
      peripheral lymphocytes, but is decreased in the tumoral counterpart. Furthermore, 
      the treatment of leukemic cells with recombinant WNT7A decreases proliferation, 
      suggesting its possible use as a therapeutic biomolecule. This study aimed to 
      evaluate the concomitant action of WNT7A and different chemotherapeutic agents 
      over proliferation and cell death of leukemia/ lymphoma derived cell lines. 
      METHODS: Ectopic expression of WNT7A was induced in CEM and BJAB cell lines by 
      using a lentiviral system. RNA expression was analyzed by microarrays and qPCR, 
      and protein expression was determined by Western Blot. Cell proliferation was 
      measured by cell counting, metabolic activity by WST-1 assay, cell death and DNA 
      content by flow cytometry. RESULTS: WNT7A ectopic expression was shown to 
      decrease cell proliferation, but the apoptosis rate of leukemic cells was not 
      altered. Moreover, these cells acquired resistance to doxorubicin, vincristine 
      and MG-132. Cell cycle analysis reveals a decrease in G1 and an increase in S and 
      G2 phases with a further upregulation of senescence- associated genes. Microarray 
      analysis reveals that most gene expression changes were related to cancer and 
      metabolic associated pathways. All those changes appear to be independent of the 
      WNT canonical pathway regulation. CONCLUSION: WNT7A negatively regulates cell 
      proliferation in leukemic cell lines and promotes resistance to chemotherapeutic 
      agents by inducing a senescence-like phenotype independently of the WNT canonical 
      pathway.

      diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Spanish Group for the Study 
      of HIV-2].
PG  - 561-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Western blot (WB) is the most commonly used test to confirm the 
      presence of antibodies against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). 
      Different criteria of interpretation of the band profile have been proposed with 
      there being no unanimity as to its reliability. The sensitivity and specificity 
      of several criteria proposed for the interpretation of WB were evaluated and the 
      individual significance of the reactivity of each band of the WB was analyzed. 
      METHODS: The presence of antibodies against HIV-1 was prospectively studied in 
      8,073 samples of subjects with risk of infection. A total of 1,993 (25%) were 
      reactive by ELISA and 1,261 were analyzed by WB, with a semiquantitative reading 
      of the bands with a point scale from 0 to 2 being performed. The final 
      interpretation of the WB (negative, doubtful, or positive) was carried out 
      following 5 recommendations of usage. A test designed with synthetic peptides 
      (Pepti-lav) was used as a reference and in discordant cases, other more specific 
      serologic tests and/or genetic analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were 
      performed. RESULTS: In order of frequency, the greater sensitivity was found to 
      be for the CRSS (Consortium for Retrovirus Serology Standardization) criteria 
      (97.9%), OMS (96.6%), CDC (Center for Disease Control) (95.9%), ARC (American Red 
      Cross) (95.6%) and FDA (99.8%). The greatest specificity was for the criteria of 
      the OMS, and FDA (99.8%). In order of frequency, the most frequent bands in HIV-1 
      + individuals were gp160 (99%), gp120, p24, p31, p55, p68, gp41, and p17 (68%). 
      In non infected individuals, the recognized bands were, in decreasing order, p24, 
      p17, p55, p68, p31, and glucoproteins. CONCLUSIONS: Different criteria of 
      interpretation of the Western blot provide different degrees of sensitivity and 
      specificity. The Western blot is a non standardized, expensive, laborious 
      technique of subjective interpretation which provides an appreciable number of 
      undetermined results.

AB  - The high genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) poses a 
      significant challenge to the diagnosis and microbiological characterization of 
      HIV infection. Because of the continual emergence of new variants and the global 
      spread of HIV groups, subtypes and recombinant forms, accurate diagnostic tools 
      are of prime importance. The present review analyzes the problems posed by HIV 
      assays for antibody screening, nucleic acid testing and patient monitoring in 
      HIV-1 non-B subtypes, as well as the utility of some recently introduced genetic 
      algorithms, such as those proposed for the characterization of viral tropism. 
      Overall, the reliability of serological and molecular tests for HIV-1 strains is 
      high, except for the more genetically diverse HIV variants (HIV-1 group O, N, and 
      HIV-2). In contrast, genetic algorithms show acceptable accuracy for HIV-1 
      subtype B, but are less accurate for non-B subtypes. In conclusion, the ongoing 
      evolution of HIV requires constant monitoring of the performance of screening 
      tests and provides a stimulus to the development of molecular assays to detect 
      all spreading and emerging HIV variants. The availability of both in vitro and 
      clinical data from studies of HIV-1 non-B subtypes will improve the performance 
      of bioinformatics tools.

TI  - [Microbiological diagnosis of HIV infection].
PG  - 632-8
AB  - Currently, there are around 150,000 HIV-infected patients in Spain. This number, 
      together with the fact that this disease is now a chronic condition since the 
      introduction of antiretroviral therapy, has generated an increasing demand on the 
      clinical microbiology laboratories in our hospitals. This increase has occurred 
      not only in the diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic diseases, but also in 
      tests related to the diagnosis and therapeutic management of HIV infection. To 
      meet this demand, the Sociedad de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología 
      Clinica (Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology) has 
      updated its standard Procedure for the microbiological diagnosis of HIV 
      infection. The main advances related to serological diagnosis, plasma viral load, 
      and detection of resistance to antiretroviral drugs are reviewed in this version 
      of the Procedure.

TI  - Induction of ovarian maturation in Penaeus monodon by molecular signal 
      interventional approach.
PG  - 572-85
LID - 10.1002/jez.b.22462 [doi]
AB  - Vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis in the hepatopancreas and ovary is negatively 
      regulated by vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH) produced in the 
      neurosecretory cell of X-organ/sinus gland complex of the eyestalks of penaeid 
      shrimp. Eyestalk ablation is used commercially to induce ovarian maturation in 
      shrimps which leads to an eventual loss of the spawner. The aim of the present 
      study was to understand the molecular mechanism of VIH regulation in ovarian 
      development and its inhibition of VTG gene expression by using a MEK-specific 
      inhibitor (U0126). The real-time quantitative PCR results showed VTG mRNA level 
      was progressively increased in the ovary and hepatopancreas of unilateral 
      eyestalk-ablated and inhibitor-treated shrimps. Western blot analysis also showed 
      that phosphoMEK was detected only in the unilateral eyestalk-ablated and control 
      shrimp, whereas phospho-MEK was not detected in inhibitor-treated shrimp. DAX-1, 
      SF-1, and StAR expression correlated with changes in VIH mRNA and altered 
      phospho-ERK levels. This is consistent with the hypothesis that suppression of 
      DAX-1 results in SF-1-mediated StAR protein upregulation of estradiol that is 
      implicated in vitellogenesis. This is the first report that demonstrates the 
      molecular mechanism of VIH suppression via MEK pathway to induce ovarian 
      maturation in female Penaeus monodon by molecular signal intervention, a 
      less-invasive method than traditional eyestalk ablation.

TI  - Gene-specific differential response to anti-apoptotic therapies in zebrafish 
      models of ocular coloboma.
PG  - 1473-84
AB  - PURPOSE: We recently demonstrated that molecular therapy using aminoglycosides 
      can overcome the underlying genetic defect in two zebrafish models of ocular 
      coloboma and showed abnormal cell death to be a key feature associated with the 
      optic fissure closure defects. In further studies to identify molecular therapies 
      for this common congenital malformation, we now examine the effects of 
      anti-apoptotic compounds in zebrafish models of ocular coloboma in vivo. METHODS: 
      Two ocular coloboma zebrafish lines (pax2.1/noi(tu29a) and lamb1/gup(m189)) were 
      exposed to diferuloylmethane (curcumin) or 
      benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(Ome)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk; a pan-caspase 
      inhibitor) for up to 8 days post-fertilization. The effects of these compounds 
      were assessed by morphology, histology, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 
      dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and western blot analysis. RESULTS: The 
      size of the coloboma in gup zebrafish mutants treated with diferuloylmethane was 
      greatly reduced. In treated mutants a reduction in TUNEL staining and a 67% 
      decrease in activated caspase-3 protein were observed. The release of cytochrome 
      c from the mitochondria into the cytosol was reduced fourfold by in vivo 
      diferuloylmethane treatment, suggesting that the drug was acting to inhibit the 
      intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Inhibition of caspases directly with zVAD-fmk also 
      resulted in a similar reduction in coloboma phenotype. Treatment with either 
      diferuloylmethane or zVAD-fmk resulted in a statistically significant 1.4 fold 
      increase in length of survival of these mutant zebrafish (p<0.001), which 
      normally succumb to the lethal genetic mutation. In contrast, the coloboma 
      phenotype in noi zebrafish mutants did not respond to either diferuloylmethane or 
      zVAD-fmk exposure, even though inhibition of apoptotic cell death was observed by 
      a reduction in TUNEL staining. CONCLUSIONS: The differential sensitivity to 
      anti-apoptotic agents in lamb1-deficient and pax2.1-deficient zebrafish models, 
      suggests that apoptotic cell death is not a final common pathway in all ocular 
      coloboma genotypes. When considering anti-cell death therapies for ocular 
      colobomatous defects attention should be paid to the genotype under 
      investigation.

TI  - [Could saliva be used to detect HIV seroconversion?].
PG  - 303-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blood is generally used for detection of antibodies associated with 
      infections. However, removal of blood samples can be problematic and is painful 
      for the patient. It requires suitable equipment and skilled staff, both of which 
      may be expensive. Some patients refuse to allow removal of blood samples because 
      they find it painful and traumatic. Removal of blood samples from children, 
      newborns, immunocompromised or overweight subjects is often particularly 
      difficult. In addition, some religions forbid the taking of blood samples. Thus, 
      it is necessary to develop alternative, simple, painless methods of sampling body 
      fluids that give results as accurate as those obtained with blood samples. Saliva 
      has been suggested as a possible alternative. Epidemiological studies and other 
      reports have shown that saliva may be of value for the detection of HIV 
      antibodies. AIM: To evaluate the potential of saliva for detection of antibodies 
      and seroconversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Section I: Saliva and serum from 1,023 
      subjects, including 150 AIDS patients, 251 TB patients of known HIV status and 
      622 subjects from at-risk groups were tested. Sera from subjects with unknown HIV 
      status were systematically tested by Abbott recombinant HIV1/HIV2 EIA. Section 
      II: Saliva and sera were obtained from a population at risk of HIV infection. Two 
      hundred and fifty consenting adults were found to be HIV-negative. Saliva was 
      collected from each subject once per week and tested the same day with the Abbott 
      test pack and Wellcozyme GACELISA. A spot of blood was also collected, dried and 
      tested using the Wellcozyme GACELISA protocol. Whenever a positive result was 
      obtained for any test, a blood sample was taken the same day or as soon as 
      possible, for Western, blot analysis. Saliva was collected with an OMNISAL device 
      (SDS, Vancouver, USA) placed under the tongue. The indicator turned blue when 
      enough fluid had been collected. The device was then removed and the saliva 
      placed in a tube with stabilized product. It was then transferred to a casting 
      tube with a filter. RESULTS: Section I: Saliva from 96 of 150 AIDS patients (64%) 
      tested positive. Serum from these patients also tested positive for HIV. 
      Thirty-two subjects of the 622 from at-risk groups tested positive for HIV in the 
      Abbott recombinant HIV1/HIV2 EIA with saliva (5.14%). Serum from these subjects 
      also tested positive for HIV in Western blot. However, saliva EIA gave 5 false 
      negative results for patients who tested positive in rapid tests and Western 
      blot. We optimized the procedure and obtained 98.69% sensitivity and 100% 
      specificity. Section II: One individual tested positive in saliva and dried blood 
      spot tests in the fourth week of the study. Western blot using serum samples 
      obtained on the next and following days showed a progressive increase in the 
      intensity of the bands, beginning with P24 and GP160 (Fig. 2). CONCLUSION: This 
      study shows that testing saliva is effective for determining HIV status early in 
      seroconversion.

TI  - [Virological diagnosis and follow-up of HIV infection. State of the art and 
      situation in Tunisia].
PG  - 395-402
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus infecting approximatively 40 
      million people worldwide. HIV is characterized by a great variability with 
      epidemiological, diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The course of infection 
      goes through three stages (acute infection, clinical latency and AIDS) with the 
      evolution of virological markers (anti-HIV antibodies, p24 antigenemia, plasma 
      RNA and proviral DNA). Direct virological diagnosis is mainly based on molecular 
      tools allowing viral genome detection and amplification with specific primers and 
      nucleic probes besides p24 antigenemia detection, and more rarely viral culture. 
      Antigenic properties of viral proteins elicit in infected patients antibody 
      synthesis, which is detected using serology (ELISA and Western blot tests). The 
      follow-up of infected patients is carried out with plasma HIV-1 RNA quantitation 
      and phenotypic or genotypic characterization of variant isolates. Virological 
      tests are prescribed according to clinical presentation (screening, acute 
      infection, newborn from HIV-infected mother). Most of these virological tools are 
      available in Tunisia, allowing both diagnosis of HIV infection and monitoring of 
      infected individuals. Regarding diagnostic tests indication and interpretation, 
      multidisciplinary concertation is hopeful in order to optimize patient 
      management.

TI  - Differential regulation of hepatopancreatic vitellogenin (VTG) gene expression by 
      two putative molt-inhibiting hormones (MIH1/2) in Pacific white shrimp 
      (Litopenaeus vannamei).

AB  - Molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), a peptide member of the crustacean hyperglycemic 
      hormone (CHH) family, is commonly considered as a negative regulator during the 
      molt cycle in crustaceans. Phylogenetic analysis of CHH family peptides in 
      penaeidae shrimps suggested that there is no significant differentiation between 
      MIH and vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone (VIH, another peptide member of CHH 
      family), by far the most potent negative regulator of crustacean vitellogenesis 
      known. Thus, MIH may also play a role in regulating vitellogenesis. In this 
      study, two previously reported putative MIHs (LivMIH1 and LivMIH2) in the Pacific 
      white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified 
      by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and further confirmed by 
      western blot. Regulation of vitellogenin (VTG) mRNA expression by recombinant 
      LivMIH1 and LivMIH2 challenge was performed by both in vitro hepatopancreatic 
      primary cells culture and in vivo injection approaches. In in vitro primary 
      culture of shrimp hepatopancreatic cells, only LivMIH2 but not LivMIH1 
      administration could improve the mRNA expression of VTG. In in vivo injection 
      experiments, similarly, only LivMIH2 but not LivMIH1 could stimulate 
      hepatopancreatic VTG gene expression and induce ovary maturation. Our study may 
      provide evidence for one isoform of MIH (MIH2 in L. vannamei) may serve as one of 
      the mediators of the physiological progress of molting and vitellogenesis. Our 
      study may also give new insight in CHH family peptides regulating reproduction in 
      crustaceans, in particular penaeidae shrimps.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Point-of-care testing and diagnosis of HIV acute infections play 
      important roles in preventing transmission, but HIV rapid diagnosis tests have 
      poor capacity to detect early infections. Filter paper can be used for capillary 
      blood collection and HIV testing using 4th generation immunoassays. OBJECTIVES: 
      Antigen/antibody combined immunoassays were evaluated for their capacity to 
      identify early HIV infections using filter paper in comparison with rapid test. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Thirty nine serum samples collected from HIV seroconverters were 
      spotted onto filter paper and tested by the Roche Elecsys(®) HIV Combi PT test 
      and the DiaSorin Liaison XL Murex HIV Ab/Ag assay. RESULTS: Fourth generation 
      immunoassays identified 34 out of 39 HIV early infections using dried serum spot, 
      whereas the Determine™ HIV-1/2 rapid test detected 24 out of 39 HIV positive 
      serum (87.2% vs 61.5% respectively, p = 0.009). p24 antigen was detected by the 
      Liaison XL in 19 dried serum samples (48.7%). In the group characterized by a 
      negative western blot, 7 out of 8 (87.5%) and 6 out of 8 (75.0%) samples were 
      found positive for HIV using the Elecsys and the Liaison XL, respectively. None 
      of these eight samples classified in this group of early acute infections were 
      found positive by the rapid test. CONCLUSION: Fourth generation Ag/Ab 
      immunoassays performed on dried serum spot had good performance for HIV testing 
      during the early phases of HIV infection. This method may be useful to detect HIV 
      early infections in hard-to-reach populations and individuals living in remote 
      areas before rapid tests become positive.

AB  - The accurate diagnosis of HIV infection demands that to consider a positive 
      result, at least three assays with different antigenic base should be used, one 
      of them, Western-Blot being mandatory for confirmation. Fourth generation ELISAs 
      shorten the window phase to 13-15 days, as they now include p24 antigen 
      detection. Proviral DNA or Viral RNA detection by molecular methods have proved 
      useful for addressing complex situations in which serology was inconclusive. 
      Viral load (HIV-RNA) is routinely used to follow-up HIV infected patients and is 
      used for treatment initiation decisions. It is also used to monitor viral 
      failure. When this happens, resistance tests are needed to guide treatment 
      changes. Resistance is also used to assess the transmission of drug resistance to 
      newly diagnosed patients. Finally, before using an anti-CCR5 drug, viral tropism 
      needs to be determined. This can be done using genotypic tests, widely available 
      in many HIV labs, or phenotypic tests, only available at certain sites.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, test developers have created rapid point-of-care tests that 
      can simultaneously detect multiple infections within the same specimen using a 
      single device. The SD BIOLINE Duo HIV/Syphilis rapid point-of-care test uses a 
      solid-phase immunochromatographic assay to detect immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and 
      IgA antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific antigens (HIV-1 
      gp41, sub O, HIV-2 gp36) and recombinant Treponema pallidum antigen (17 kDa) in 
      human serum. This study was a multisite laboratory-based evaluation of the 
      performance of SD BIOLINE HIV/Syphilis Duo test using previously characterized 
      sera in 6 countries. METHODS: Laboratories in Ghana, Mexico, Laos, Togo, Kenya, 
      and Myanmar participated in the evaluation during 2012-2013. Each site 
      characterized sera using T pallidum particle agglutination assay or T pallidum 
      hemagglutination assay and HIV enzyme immunoassay, Western blot, and/or HIV 
      antibody rapid tests. Those gold standard test results were compared with SD 
      BIOLINE Duo test results. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of test 
      performance and used the exact binomial method to calculate 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity for the HIV antibody 
      test component (n = 2336) were estimated at 99.91% (95% CI, 99.51% and 100%) and 
      99.67% (95% CI, 99.16% and 99.91%), respectively. For the T pallidum test 
      component (n = 2059), the sensitivity and specificity were estimated at 99.67% 
      (95% CI, 98.82% and 99.96%) and 99.72% (95% CI, 99.29% and 99.92%), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of the SD BIOLINE HIV/Syphilis Duo 
      test were consistently high across sera specimens from 6 countries around the 
      world. Dual rapid tests should be considered for improved HIV and syphilis 
      screening coverage.

PG  - 58-64
AB  - The purpose of this study is to report the results of the authors' investigation 
      to apply the western blot technique (WB UP-LCS) in the diagnosis of human 
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. To do this, the authors 
      separated the proteins of the HIV-1 virus by electrophoresis, based on their 
      molecular weight, in poliacilamide gel with SDS (SDS-PAGE) during 3 hours at 200 
      volts. Then they electrotransferred these proteins to nitrocellulose paper during 
      four hours at 200 milliamperes, with the aid of external cooling. The 
      nitrocellulose strips were evaluated considering the incubation time (1 and 16 
      hours), two conjugates (human anti IgG with Peroxidase and human anti IgG Biotin 
      plus Streptatividine with Peroxidase) and two dilutions of the patients' sera 
      (1/50 and 1/100). Based on their results the Authors conclude that, in the first 
      place, the optimal conditions for the test include a dilution of 1/100 of the 
      patients serum, incubation of the serum for 16 hours and the use of the conjugate 
      of anti human IgG with Biotin and Streptavidine with Peroxidase; secondary, that 
      the immunologic reactivity against proteins p24 and gp 160/120 is the most 
      important diagnostic criterion for the confirmation of infection with HIV-1 and 
      that they obtained a diagnostic correlation of 100% at a cost which was 5 to 7 
      times less than that of the commercial system.

TI  - [Predictive markers of HIV and HCV infection and co-infection among inmates in a 
      Spanish prison].
PG  - 53-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and factors associated with HIV and HCV 
      infection among inmates of a Spanish prison. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was 
      carried out in July 2001. We determined HCV (ELISA and RIBA-3) and HIV (ELISA and 
      Western-blot) serology in the prison population. Study variables included age, 
      sex, nationality and previous intravenous drug use (IDU). In IDU inmates we 
      analyzed the age when intravenous drug use was initiated, years of consumption, 
      age at first admission in prison and syringe sharing with other inmates. The 
      subpopulations of Arab and Romani (gypsy) inmates were studied differentially. 
      RESULTS: A total of 800 inmates (mean age 34.2 6 6.2 years) were evaluated; 74.3% 
      were Spanish and 33.6% IDU. HCV serology was obtained in 730 inmates and HIV 
      serology in 773 with the following seroprevalence results: HCV 38.2%, HIV 19.1% 
      and HCV-HIV co-infection 18.8%. The variables associated with HCV or HIV 
      infection in the univariate analysis were Spanish nationality, previous IDU and 
      coinfection by the other virus. In the multivariate analysis, only coinfection 
      and, particularly, previous IDU (HCV infection: adjusted ORp 104.8 [95% CI: 
      49.4-222.2]) (HIV infection adjusted ORp 45.1 [95% CI: 14.0-144.9]) maintained an 
      association with the two infections. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV and HCV 
      infection and coinfection is high in Spanish prisons. Infection by either of 
      these viruses and previous IDU were independently associated with both 
      infections. The percentage of non-Spanish inmates with these infections is low.

PG  - 543-52
AB  - AIMS: To determine the number and type of HIV tests requested in general practice 
      (GP) and in hospital outpatient clinics, to identify principle risk behaviors, to 
      determine the percentage of HIV positive tests and to identify possible factors 
      associated with the request of HIV tests. METHODS: Cross-sectional, analytical 
      and observational study, involving 80 GPs and 45 hospital specialists in the 
      region of Lisbon. All requests for HIV tests were analysed during a 12 month 
      period. RESULTS: 936 HIV tests were requested, with a mean of 12.47 in GP and 
      0.69 in the hospital. Risk behaviors observed were mainly heterosexual contacts 
      and intravenous drug abuse (IVDA). The motives of the requests mainly were 
      pregnancy, risk behaviors in GP and the presence of symptoms suggesting HIV 
      infection in the hospital. The initiative of the request came from doctors in 70% 
      of the cases. The percentage of HIV positive tests (ELISA + Western blot) was 
      4.2% in GP and 32% in the hospital. According to risk behaviors, the percentage 
      of seropositivity was 33% in homo/bisexuals, 13% in IVDA, 7% in heterosexuals 
      with risk behaviors and 0.2% in individuals with unidentified risk behaviors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of request of HIV tests differ in hospital and in GP. 
      In a significant percentage of cases, no informed consent was obtained prior to 
      HIV testing, both in hospital and GP. This study may serve as an indicator of the 
      need for information and education programs concerning HIV testing directed to 
      health professionals and the general population.

TI  - WNT7A Expression is Downregulated in T Lymphocytes after T-Cell Receptor 
      Activation Due to Histone Modifications and in T-ALL by DNA Methylation.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1007/s00005-020-00583-5 [doi]
AB  - WNT signaling pathway regulates several processes involved in the homeostasis of 
      normal cells. Its dysregulation is associated with pathological outcomes like 
      cancer. We previously demonstrated that downregulation of WNT7A correlates with 
      higher proliferation rates in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the 
      regulation of this gene in pathological and normal conditions remains unexplored. 
      In this work, we aimed to analyze the transcriptional regulation of WNT7A in 
      leukemic cells and in normal T lymphocytes after a proliferative stimulus. WNT7A 
      expression was measured in blood cells and in T lymphocytes after 
      phytohemagglutinin-L (PHA-L) treatment or T-cell receptor (TCR) activation by 
      qPCR and Western blot. Promoter methylation was assessed using 
      methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, and histone modifications were 
      determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR. In T-cell acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), WNT7A expression is silenced through DNA 
      methylation of CpG island in the promoter region. In normal peripheral blood 
      cells, WNT7A is mainly expressed by monocytes and T lymphocytes. TCR activation 
      induces the downregulation of WNT7A in normal T lymphocytes by changes in histone 
      methylation marks (H3K4me2/3) and histone deacetylases. A proliferative stimulus 
      mediated by IL-2 keeps WNT7A expression at low levels but in the absence of IL-2, 
      the expression of this gene tends to be restored. Furthermore, after TCR 
      activation and WNT7A downregulation, target genes associated with the WNT 
      canonical pathway were upregulated indicating an independent activity of WNT7A 
      from the WNT canonical pathway. WNT7A expression is silenced by long-term DNA 
      methylation in T-ALL-derived cells and downregulated by histone modifications 
      after TCR activation in normal T lymphocytes.

AB  - This study aims to determine the prevalence of HIV infection among patients 
      hospitalized for tuberculosis in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Ibn 
      Rochd University Hospital in Casablanca and factors associated with TB-HIV 
      co-infection. We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study in November 
      2016. The database of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Laboratory of 
      Microbiology and Immunology at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital was examined. 
      All the patients with tuberculosis confirmed using Lowenstein Jensen culture 
      medium and HIV Infection confirmed using Western Blot test between January 2013 
      and December 2015 were included. During the study period, 117 cases of 
      tuberculosis were confirmed by culture. Fourty six (39.3%) patients had confirmed 
      HIV infection. Thirty-four co-infected patients (73.9%) had extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis (this form was associated with co-infection (p=0.04)). All patients 
      underwent TB treatment and anti-retroviral treatment according to the indication. 
      The Evolution was favorable in 32 patients (69.6%) and 10 deaths were recorded 
      (21.7%). Mortality rate was higher in co-infected patients than in TB patients 
      without HIV (8.4%), (p=0.04). This study highlights a relatively high prevalence 
      of HIV infection among tuberculosis patients. TB-HIV co-infection is associated 
      with severe forms of tuberculosis and with an increase in mortality rate among TB 
      patients; hence the importance of strengthening anti-co-infection joint 
      activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the experience of the Immunodeficiency Clinic of the 
      Department of Infectious Diseases at Hospital Infantile de México "Federico 
      Gómez", in the management of children with HIV infection and AIDS. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: the medical records of 130 patients with a clinical and laboratory 
      diagnosis of HIV/AIDS seen between September 1985 and June 1994 were reviewed. 
      Data was obtained regarding diagnosis, epidemiological risk factors, clinical 
      features, types and numbers of bacterial and opportunistic infections, 
      malignancies, hospitalizations, general and specific treatment and outcome. The 
      diagnosis followed CDC guidelines and was established in all 130 patients 
      serologically with ELISA and Western Blot. In infants < 18 months, diagnosis was 
      made by detection of p24 and/or viral culture in two separate occasions. RESULTS: 
      Data from 130 subjects was obtained; 74 were male and 56 female for a M:F ratio 
      of 1.3:1. With regards to mode of transmission, 62.3% was vertical, 20.8% post 
      transfusion, 8.5% hemophiliacs (the latter two males were cases before occurred 
      1987), 6.2% sexual and 2.2% unknown. With regards to additional risk factors, in 
      35 cases the parents were heterosexual, in 18 one parent had a history of 
      transfusion, and in eight the father was bisexual. According to the CDC 
      classification; 16 had indeterminate infection or PO; nine were asymptomatic or 
      P1; and 105 were symptomatic or P2. Eighty two patients had nonspecific findings, 
      60 had neurologic manifestations, 18 had lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia and 
      four had secondary malignancies. It was possible to document 296 episodes of 
      secondary infections: 154 bacterial, 58 opportunistic, and 84 with other 
      pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: in Mexico, as in other Western countries, vertical 
      transmission has become the dominant form of acquiring HIV infection in children, 
      reflecting a change in the epidemiology of infection in women of child bearing 
      age. Moreover, since IV drug use is a very limited phenomenon in Mexico, 
      heterosexual transmission is the major form of transmission in women.

AB  - The initial surveys on the seroprevalence of anti-HIV-1 antibodies (HIV-Ab) in 
      hemodialysis units in the State of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) were done in 1985. The 
      alarming figures around 15% were ascribed to the poor quality of blood collected 
      from "professional donors" in exchange for food or money. Recently a concerted 
      effort has been launched to curtail the blood trade. We decided to investigate 
      whether these measures have produced any impact on HIV-Ab seroprevalence in two 
      satellite units in RJ. Segumed was among the units studied in 1985. We conducted 
      another survey in 1987 on the same patients previously studied. CS Grajaú, a new 
      unit where most of the patients were new on dialysis, was studied in 1988. A 
      HIV-1 ELISA was used as screening. Positive results were confirmed by Western 
      blot. Results in Segumed showed a marked difference in seroprevalence of HIV-Ab 
      (14.4% vs 3.6%). The two cases identified in 1987 were among the ones identified 
      in 1985. No patient became infected between the two surveys despite the lack of 
      isolation of HIV carriers and the increase in blood use during the period. In CS 
      Grajaú two cases were found (2.4% prevalence) but one of them was known since 
      1985 when living with a transplant. A review of all similar reports from RJ area 
      suggest a trend towards lower figures in recent years. We conclude that the 
      chance of acquiring HIV infection is currently low in the centers studied and may 
      be falling in RJ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      that the increased surveillance and even the closure of blood banks has resulted 
      in an improvement of the quality of blood available for transfusion in RJ.

AB  - The search for specific antibodies against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
      type-1 (Ab anti HIV 1), using an immunoenzymatic test and a subsequent 
      confirmation test (Western Blot-WB) in patients who were previously positive or 
      borderline at the first test, singled out from about 12500 tested subjects, 
      fifteen patients with indeterminate WB (WBi) for the presence of an abnormal 
      band. The presence of p24 was predominant in those WBi (about 50%); generally p24 
      was the only band found. In all serum samples with WBi, the viral antigen p24 (Ag 
      p24) was absent. In 3 subjects with WBi, after at least six months from the first 
      test, not only did the same pattern persist but also the search for VIH-1 DNA 
      sequence using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gave a negative result. 
      According to our experience and the literature on the subject, we suggest that 
      patients with low risk of infection and whose WBi does not modify with time have 
      a remote possibility of being infected by HIV.

PG  - 116-21
AB  - The aim of this paper is to ascertain the spread pattern of HIV-2 in patients at 
      risk in an area of frequent contact with sub-Saharan Africa and evaluate the 
      seric marker of HIV-2 infection. 606 serum samples from 524 patients were 
      analysed. 445 patients were intravenous drug users (IDU), 17 used inhaled drugs, 
      26 had HIV-2 (+)partner, and others 36 high-risk practice. The ser were analysed 
      for HIV-1 and HIV-2, using ELISA, Western blot (LAVBLOT 1, LAVBLOT 2) and 
      specific synthetic peptides such as gp 41 and gp 36 (PEPTI-LAV 1-2). 245 out of 
      524 (47%) patients were HIV-1 (+). 65 out of 524 (12.4%) were Elavia-2 and HIV-1 
      (+). All samples tests using Western blot 1, confirmed the results of the ELISA 
      (2 protein of the membrane). The Western blot of HIV-2 Elavia-2 (+) in 2/53 
      showed two proteins of the membrane and 26/53 one protein of the membrane and 
      several of the core. The PEPTIL-LAV 1-2 was HIV-1 positive in 77/77 HIV-1 serum 
      samples and in 10 HIV-2 positive, however, in all cases the HIV-2 reactivity was 
      lower than HIV-1, allowing the orientation of the diagnosis towards the HIV-1 
      positive serum. In spite of the frequent contact with Africa, the spread of HIV-2 
      in the south of Spain is still quite insignificant. The Western blot of HIV-2 
      gives a high proportion of double reactivity, including those cases with 
      restrictive criteria to be positive. PEPTI-LAV 1-2 has proved most useful in the 
      diagnosis orientation in the cases of crossed reactivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

PG  - 385-96
AB  - The present work explores the use of image digitalization of western blot (WB) 
      aiming to extract more information about the humoral immune response of human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, and to analyze obtained data 
      in a multivariate manner. The digitalization and analysis of WB images was 
      performed on 115 sera. Images were analyzed either qualitatively: dendogram and 
      principal component analysis (PCA) or quantitatively: PCA of the total bands, 
      taking either the antigens, which belong to the virus, or only those which do 
      not. Results show the feasibility of mechanical diagnosis of a large number of WB 
      images. The dendogram and the qualitative PCA satisfactorily separated white 
      images, images with less than four bands, and images with more complex patterns. 
      Quantitative analysis, which keeps more information, separated the images of 
      negative, undetermined and positive diagnosis quite precisely. It was also found 
      that the positive images with complex patterns of antigen recognition correlate 
      better with asymptomatic individuals. Image analysis also revealed various other 
      bands in WB which do not seem to correspond to viral proteins and could represent 
      autoantigens or crossed antigens between HIV and humans which may cause 
      autoimmunity. Digital analysis of WB images is thus demonstrated to be of great 
      usefulness in the diagnosis and of potential great interest in following the 
      evolution and exploring the pathogenesis of AIDS.

TI  - [Asymptomatic bearing of Leishmania infantum among Tunisian HIV infected 
      patients].
PG  - 521-4
AB  - The number of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases is in continuous growth in 
      Mediterranean countries. In Tunisia, in addition to the traditional infantile 
      form, more and more cases in immunocompetent or immunocompromised adults have 
      been reported. However, co-infection VL-HIV remains rare in Tunisia and diagnosis 
      of all the cases up till now has been done using traditional techniques 
      (serology, direct examination and culture of bone marrow). However, the last 
      years, several studies proved the greatest sensitivity of PCR in VL diagnosis. We 
      carried out a systematic detection of Leishmania in peripheral blood for 25 HIV 
      infected patients (10 were asymptomatic, 6 presented a fever and/or a paleness 
      and/or an asthenia, and 9 had an opportunist infection other than VL). In all 
      cases, the culture on Novy-Nicolle-McNeal (NNN) medium was negative by the end of 
      the month. Serology carried out for 22 patients was negative in IFI in 17 cases, 
      positive at the 1/20 for four others and positive at the 1/40 for one patient 
      (confirmed by Western Blot technique). A PCR using the primers Lei70L-Lei70R, 
      specific of the gene of Leishmania infantum, allowed the display of the specific 
      band of 345 bp for 17 samples. The higher sensitivity of PCR compared to 
      conventional methods is subject to the difficulty of result interpretation in PCR 
      positive testing among patients not having any other marker of the disease which 
      raises the question of significance for this asymptomatic bearing.

TI  - [Detection of HIV infection in pregnant women by rapid testing: a successful 
      strategy to reduce its vertical transmission].
PG  - 321-6
AB  - A high percentage of Uruguayan pregnant women are not under medical control. As a 
      consequence, vertically transmission of HIV infection reaches to 50%. The aim of 
      this study was to know the prevalence of HIV infection in pregnant women who did 
      not know their serological status and to decrease mother-to-child transmission. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: from January 2002 to January 2004 the HIV rapid test was 
      performed to every pregnant woman that assisted to a public Uruguayan hospital 
      unaware of her condition. The proper prophylactic decisions were adopted 
      according to gestational age. The newborn infants were classified according to 
      CDC criteria. HIV infection prevalence in pregnant women and in their newborn 
      infants was calculated. RESULTS: there were 34,338 obstetric consultations and 
      4,599 rapid tests were performed. Fifty-nine turned out positive in 58 women, 8 
      of them knew their serological status previously. The HIV infection prevalence 
      was 1.1% (IC95% 0.8-1.4). Five cases were discharged: 1 false positive and 3 
      miscarriages and 1 abortion. Ten women dropped out in the follow up. Twelve women 
      received TARV during pregnancy for over a week. Thirty-nine infants could be 
      controlled: 33 seroreverted, 4 were exposed and 2 became infected. 
      Mother-to-child transmission was 5.1%. If all patients who dropped out the follow 
      up were infected, the transmission rate should be of 20.4%; therefore the 
      infection would have been prevented in 16 children. As many women and children 
      were lost, other complementary actions as counseling and social worker interview 
      should be adopted in order to improve the yield of rapid test screening strategy.

AB  - Quality assurance of HIV testing is essential to correctly assess the HIV 
      epidemic. To describe the characteristics of HIV testing and identify features 
      that could be improved, a questionnaire on the quality of HIV tests was sent to 
      Catalan laboratories in 1998. The survey revealed variability in the procedures 
      used by the participating laboratories when performing HIV tests. Some of the 
      laboratories were still performing incorrect activities such as identifying HIV 
      specimens with specific labels, extracting new specimens for a second test to 
      confirm diagnosis, or failing to guarantee the confidentiality of the results. 
      The criteria for HIV testing should be standardized according to the purpose of 
      the test and the prevalence of the infection in the population analyzed. This 
      approach would improve the quality of the results of diagnostic tests, since the 
      overall concept of quality includes the entire process (pre-test, test and 
      post-test).

TI  - [Relationship between HLA antigens and the HIV infection in patients from the 
      state of Zulia].
PG  - 109-13
AB  - PURPOSE: Some genetic factors associated to the HLA system phenotypes may 
      allegedly predispose to the development of infection in patients exposed to the 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). So the aim of this study was to assess if 
      certain HLA antigens are positive or negative risk factors in the development of 
      AIDS in Zulia State. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 62 samples were studied, 31 
      from HIV seropositive subjects and 31 form healthy individuals. The patients were 
      subclassified into four groups in accordance with Atlanta's CDC guidelines. Tests 
      for histocompatibility including HLA-A-B-C, DR and DQ typing were performed with 
      Terasaki's technique. VIH positivity was determined by ELISA and confirmed by 
      Western Blot. The statistical evalub1p4n was performed with the chi 2 test for 
      antigen frequency comparison, the relative risk (RR) was estimated with the Ryder 
      and Svelgaard test, and the inferential analysis was made by means of 
      non-parametric statistics. RESULTS: Most patients were included in CDC's groups 
      II and IV, 48.4% and 29.0%, respectively. Increased B35 and DQw2 and decreased 
      B39 and DR2 antigens were found when comparing the HLA distribution in the sample 
      and the antigenic frequency of the population. RR > 1 was observed in the 
      infected patients A for A1, A3, A10, A11, B5, B7, B12, B14, B35, B61, CW4, DR4, 
      DRW52 and DQW2 HLA antigens. A positive association between symptomatic infected 
      patients and antigen B35 was present (X = 7.045). CONCLUSION: The findings 
      reported here suggest that antigen B35 is a major risk factor for the development 
      of AIDS.

TI  - [Seroprevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the ten regions of the Ivory 
      Coast].
PG  - 193-8
AB  - Ivory Coast, a sub-Saharan African country, has 14 million inhabitants. Two AIDS 
      cases were reported to the WHO in 1985. By December 31st 1996, there were a total 
      of 37,878 AIDS cases in Ivory Coast, 6,727 of which were new cases reported in 
      1996. Heterosexual transmission is the predominant means of HIV infection in 
      Africa and women of childbearing age account for a substantial proportion of the 
      individuals infected. The aim of this study was to follow the progression of 
      infection in the various regions of the country by comparing data from two time 
      periods: Period I: 1986 to 1989; Period II: 1994 to 1996. LOCATION: Samples were 
      taken in regional maternal and child protection centers. Recruitment method: 
      Women were recruited anonymously, during their antenatal care. BIOLOGICAL 
      ANALYSIS: Period I (1986 to 1989), 2,604 pregnant women. Anti-HIV antibodies were 
      detected with: Abbott HIV-1 EIA Recombinant (Chicago) used initially, for 1,200 
      sera; Abbott HIV-1/HIV-2 Recombinant (Chicago) used later for the remaining sera. 
      There was no commercially available test for HIV-2 during this first period, so 
      all samples with Rm0.8 (R = optical density/cut-off) were also tested by western 
      blotting. Period II (1994 to 1996), 2,935 pregnant women. All sera were tested 
      with Enzygnost HIV-1-2 and Enzygnost HIV-1-2 Plus, produced by Behring (Germany). 
      All sera testing positive in EIA were also tested by western blotting. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of HIV infection was 4.23% for Period I and 12.53% for Period II. 
      No region of Ivory Coast was completely free of these 2 viruses after the 
      mid-1980s. Women aged 20 to 29 years of age were the most likely to be infected, 
      for both periods. The highest prevalence of HIV-2 was that for women aged between 
      20 and 29 years and HIV-2 infection occurred mostly in the South, Southwest and 
      West regions. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of HIV infection is now at least 10% in 
      each region of the country. Abidjan is no longer the city with the highest levels 
      of infection, as shown by the results for Period II. The East and West have the 
      highest levels of HIV infection, and the prevalence of HIV in these areas is 
      significantly higher than that for Abidjan (p = 0.007 for the East and p = 0.009 
      for the West).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the time-trend in exposure categories and HIV 
      seroprevalence among adolescents who underwent to voluntary testing in the period 
      1986-2000. METHODS: This study covered all adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years, at 
      their first test for HIV in a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Madrid. 
      Gender, age and HIV risk behaviours were collected. HIV diagnosis relies on ELISA 
      test and Western blot confirmation. Time trends in HIV seroprevalence and 
      exposure categories were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 1327 adolescents, 52% 
      women and 22% under 18 years, were studied. The annual number of adolescents 
      remained through the time, but injecting drug users (IDU) and IDU partners 
      declined and female sex workers rose. 108 adolescents were diagnosed with HIV 
      infection -71% were IDU-. HIV seroprevalence was 8.1% -31.3% in IDU-. It declined 
      from 18.2% in 1986 to 1.5% in 1995, and after then it held steady under 4%. This 
      decline involved several risk categories and was statistically significant in 
      homo/bisexual men and female sex workers. The logistic regression analysis, 
      adjusting for changes in exposure categories, showed an annual reduction in HIV 
      seroprevalence (OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: HIV seroprevalence 
      has decreased due to the fall of new young IDU and the decrease of seroprevalence 
      within several exposure categories. HIV infections and risk behaviours continue 
      happened among adolescents.

      symptoms].
PG  - 474-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Any atypical psychiatric disorder, especially if associated with 
      somatic manifestations and when any psychiatric antecedents are missing, should 
      lead to search for an organic pathology, and notably a Human Immunodeficiency 
      Virus (HIV) infection. In the case of Primary Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
      Infection (PHI), which is often symptomatic, the diagnosis is seldom made, 
      probably because of atypical or non specific manifestations. Therefore, it is 
      essential to consider such a diagnosis, because it may have important clinical 
      and public health consequences (stopping the contamination chain). CASE-REPORT: 
      We present the case of a 38 year-old homosexual man from West Indies, in whom the 
      diagnosis of PHI had been made on the basis of psychiatric symptoms evoking a 
      Major Depressive Episode with a doubt on the presence of psychotic symptoms. To 
      our knowledge, this is the first report of psychiatric PHI found in scientific 
      literature. Clinical presentation was atypical: the patient had no psychiatric 
      history (except probably a schizotypical personality, according to his family), 
      symptoms were atypical (sudden onset and fast improvement) associated with 
      somatic symptoms (fever, headache, sound intolerance), the latter possibly due to 
      a meningo-encephalitis, which had been underestimated and attributed to 
      dehydration in a period when France was faced with an important and unexpected 
      heatwave. Blood samples were performed on admission and revealed a thrombopenia 
      and presence of HIV P24 antigen, testifying a contamination by HIV 2 to 4 weeks 
      earlier, this possibility having been confirmed by the patient. Further analyses 
      found a Western-Blot partially positive test and an HIV viral load of 315 711 Eq 
      copies/mL. DISCUSSION: The main question about this report is the primary or 
      secondary nature of psychiatric symptoms towards HIV infection, given that in 
      this patient mood alteration could have possibly occurred, before HIV 
      contamination, due to particularities of his personal and professional life. We 
      can also question whether the neurological manifestations of PHI might be changed 
      by a schizotypical personality. Further reports are required to answer these 
      questions.

TI  - [Evaluation of the surveillance system for human immunodeficiency virus 
      infections of Navarra, Spain, 1985-2003].
PG  - 387-98
AB  - BACKGROUND: Navarra has an information system of HIV diagnoses working since the 
      beginning of the epidemic up to the present day. This study aims at describing 
      and evaluating this system, focusing on its sensitivity. METHODS: The updated 
      guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems from the CDC were 
      used to describe the purpose and operation of the system and to analyse its 
      attributes for the period 1985-2003. For the evaluation of the sensitivity the 
      regional database of antiretrovirals distribution was used. RESULTS: The HIV 
      surveillance system of Navarra is confidential and name-based, and includes all 
      HIV-infection cases diagnosed each year. The information sources of the system 
      are: (a) all the laboratories in the public health system that perform the 
      western blot test, and (b) hospital discharge registries. The system covers the 
      entire population of Navarre (584,734 inhabitants). It uses the HIV case 
      definition proposed by the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of 
      AIDS. The system is well-accepted by the community and by all the stakeholders, 
      including those providing data. By the end of 2003 it included 2302 HIV cases, 
      and 98.8% of all patients who had ever received antiretrovirals in Navarra. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The HIV information system of Navarra is simple, useful, 
      well-accepted and highly sensitive. The information about antiretroviral 
      distribution was useful for this evaluation.

TI  - [HTLV-I infection in a high-risk group].
PG  - 349-52
AB  - The aim of this study is to detect the presence of HTLV-1 in a high-risk 
      population in west Andalusia. We studied 267 samples of serum from 255 patients: 
      179 of these patients being intravenous drug-users, 14 had ADVP sexual partners, 
      16 were inhalation drug-users, 4 were hemophiliacs, 9 had other high-risk habits 
      and 25 hematological patients afflicted with leukemia or lymphoma. All of them 
      were tested for antibodies against HTLV-1 by means of an in vitro qualitative 
      ELISA technique (ELISA Du Pont HTLV-1). The positive results were confirmed by 
      the Western blot technique. Additionally, the p24 antigen and the antibodies 
      against VIH-1 and VIH-2 (ENV/CORE) were analysed, except in the 25 hematological 
      patients. We found 20 serum samples positive to HTLV-1 by ELISA (7.4%), but only 
      1 (0.3%) was confirmed by the Western blot technique. The prevalence of VIH-1 was 
      46%; 9% had p24 VIH antigen and 26% had false positive ELISA to VIH-2. We found a 
      statistically significant relationship (p = 0.0005) between positive ELISA to 
      HTLV-1 and antibodies against VIH. We conclude that HTLV-1 has penetrated into 
      the high-risk population of west Andalusia , although not yet to a great degree, 
      and point out the need for seric epidemiological surveillance to prevent the 
      spread of the retrovirus in these groups.

      Mexico].
PG  - 38-42
AB  - In México, since may 1986, the mandatory detection of antibodies against HIV in 
      blood and derivates for the use by humans was legislated, one year later the 
      prohibition of blood trade took effect. The impact of the Sanitary Normativity in 
      the seroprevalence of anti HIV antibodies between blood donors one year before 
      and one year after it took result was compared. A sample was taken from 4743 
      serums of donors of 6 blood banks in Guadalajara between june 1986 and june 1988; 
      4020 in the first year and 723 the next. In all the samples the presence of anti 
      HIV antibodies was determined by the ELISA assay and the positive ones were 
      confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence and by Western blot. During the first 
      year, the seroprevalence fluctuated between 2.02 and 30.15 percent depending on 
      different factors, differing from the second year where the seroprevalence was 
      0.14 percent. It is concluded that the mandatory detection of antibodies against 
      HIV and the prohibition of blood trade, have been definitive factors to decrease 
      the incidence of HIV in blood donors.

TI  - [Kaposi's sarcoma during HIV infection in Morocco (apropos of 50 cases)].
PG  - 86-9
AB  - Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common neoplasm to be found among AIDS patients. The 
      purpose of this retrospective study is to determine the epidemiological, 
      clinical, therapeutic features and the evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma in Moroccan 
      patients suffering from AIDS. Between January 1987 and December 1999, 696 
      patients with AIDS were hospitalized in the department of infectious diseases of 
      Casablanca. Fifty of them (7%) had Kaposi's sarcoma. AIDS was confirmed by ELISA 
      and Western-Blot. The diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma was established by clinical 
      aspect and I or by histologically study. It concerned 46 men and 4 women. The 
      average age was 32.5 years. The homosexuality was noted in 38% of patients and 
      the heterosexuality in 56% of cases. AIDS was revealed by Kaposi's sarcoma in 82% 
      of cases. The Lesions were found in the skin (96%), in the skin and mucous 
      membranes (56%), in the lung (14%), in the gastrointestinal tract (12%) and in 
      the lymphatic nodes (8%). The average CD4 cells count was 212.8/mm3. The 
      chemotherapy was instituted in 43 patients and the radiotherapy in 5 patients 
      (alone or associated with chemotherapy). Four patients received HAART. Six 
      patients didn't received any treatment. The evolution has been characterized by 
      the death in 61% of patients. This death was due to Kaposi's sarcoma in six 
      patients and to opportunistic infections in the others cases. Our study 
      demonstrates the high incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma as an inaugurating event of 
      AIDS, the severity of the visceral involvement, the limit of our therapeutic 
      materials and the wrong prognosis of this disease.

AB  - The objective of this report was to evaluate oral fluid and urine as optional 
      samples for HIV-1 confirmatory test using DAVIH-BLOT system (Laboratorios DAVIH, 
      La Habana, Cuba), for which they were compared with their corresponding serum 
      samples in a group of 125 individuals. In band pattern analysis, predominant 
      antibodies in positives oral fluid and urine samples against p34, p68, gp41, 
      gp120, were no different from their corresponding sera according to the 
      proportion comparison test (p < 0,001). Relative sensitivity and specificity of 
      this system were 100% in oral fluid and 98, 75% and 100% in urine samples 
      respectively. These results support optional use of oral fluid and urine that, 
      with slight modifications in the diagnostic system, can be applied for HIV-1 
      antibody confirmation testing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to analyze the implementation of a rapid 
      HIV test in Asturias (Spain). METHODS: The study was conducted in two STI Units 
      using the Determine® HIV-1/2 test. RESULTS: A total of 1011 people were tested, 
      of whom 65.3% had never been tested for HIV previously, and 71.4% were 
      heterosexual men. Twenty-one tests were confirmed positive by Enzyme 
      Immunoassay/Western Blot (EIA/WB) assay An increase was observed in the diagnosis 
      of HIV. CONCLUSION: Awareness campaigns and rapid tests could be effective 
      methods for the early diagnosis of HIV.

TI  - [Risk factors for the heterosexual transmission of HIV from man to woman: a 
      Spanish multicenter study].
PG  - 721-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to estimate the rate of heterosexual 
      transmission of HIV in a population of intravenous drug users (IVDU), as to well 
      as to identify the possible risk factors associated. METHODS: One hundred thirty 
      heterosexual couples were analyzed in which the male was seropositive for the 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with the only possible risk factor for the 
      companion being the sexual intercourse with the case index. RESULTS: The rate of 
      global transmission estimated was 16% (confidence interval of 95% = 10-22.4%). 
      The risk factors significantly associated to HIV transmission were: case index of 
      over 30 years of age (OR = 3.1), clinical status IV (OR = 4.1), less than 0.8 x 
      10(8) lymphocytes/I (OR = 7), antecedents of sexually transmitted disease (STD) 
      in the woman (OR = 4), and the practice of anal intercourse (OR = 3.1). In the 
      multivariate analysis only the clinical status of the case index and the STC 
      antecedents of the woman were statistically significant (p less than 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study some of the classical risk factors for the 
      heterosexual transmission of HIV have been confirmed, and the importance of 
      decreasing the prevalence of STD in the IVDU collective in Spain has been 
      corroborated to lower heterosexual transmission and, indirectly the vertical 
      transmission of AIDS.

      for heterosexual HIV transmission. 130 couples from 17 centers in Andalusia, 
      Cataluna, and Madrid, who met the criteria and agreed to participate, were 
      studied between June 1988 and February 1990. The index case in all couples was a 
      male partner seropositive for HIV infection. Exclusion criteria for the female 
      partner included intravenous drug use, blood transfusion since 1980, or sexual 
      relations in the past 6 months with an individual other than the index case. All 
      women were screened for HIV antibodies with the ELISA test, with confirmation of 
      positive results by Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence. Around 70% of 
      participants in center collecting sociodemographic information were illiterate of 
      had primary educations, and over half had children. 40% of the index cases had a 
      history of sexual contacts with prostitutes, over 20% reported more than 5 sexual 
      partners in the past 5 years, and 18% had had other sexual partners in addition 
      to the partner interviewed since learning of their seropositivity. Over half of 
      couples had been together for more than 5 years. 32% of the women reported other 
      sexual partners in the past 5 years, excluding the past 6 months. 70% of the 
      couples interviewed reported having sexual relations 1-3 times weekly. 25% 
      reported having anal intercourse. 33% of the men and 17% of the women reported a 
      history of sexually transmitted diseases. 11 additional cases of sexually 
      transmitted disease in men and 8 in women were diagnosed in the study. The rate 
      of transmission was 16% (21/130), with a 95% confidence interval between 
      10-22.4%. The risk factors significantly associated with HIV transmission were: 
      index case over 30 years old (odds ratio of 3.1), clinical stage 4 (odds ratio 
      4.1), lymphocyte level under 800 (odds ratio of 7), history of sexually 
      transmitted diseases in the woman (odds ratio of 4), and practice of anal 
      intercourse (odds ratio of 3.1). The clinical stage of the index case and history 
      of sexually transmitted disease in the woman were the only risk factors 
      statistically significant in multivariate analysis. The lymphocyte population was 
      omitted from the multivariate analysis, since it was known for only 63 men. The 
      possible effect of condom use could not be determined because only 4 couples used 
      them regularly.

TI  - The E2-C vihar is required for the correct spatiotemporal proteolysis of cyclin B 
      and itself undergoes cyclical degradation.
PG  - 1723-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proteolytic degradation of mitotic regulatory proteins first requires 
      these targets to be ubiquitinated. This is regulated at the level of conjugation 
      of ubiquitin to substrates by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) 
      ubiquitin-protein ligase. Substrate specificity and temporal activity of the 
      APC/C has been thought to lie primarily with its two activators, Cdc20/Fizzy and 
      Cdh1/Fizzy-related. RESULTS: Here, we show that reduction in the E2 
      ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) of the E2-C family that is encoded by the 
      Drosophila gene vihar (vih), by either mutation or RNAi, leads to an accumulation 
      of cells in a metaphase-like state. Cyclin B accumulates to high levels in all 
      mitotic vih cells, particularly at the spindle poles. Vihar E2-C is present in 
      the cytoplasm of mitotic cells but also associates with centrosomes, and its own 
      degradation is initiated at the metaphase-anaphase transition. Expression of 
      destruction D box mutants of vihar in the syncytial embryo results in mitotic 
      arrest at late anaphase. In contrast to hypomorphic mutants, Cyclin B is degraded 
      at the spindle poles and accumulates in the equatorial region of the spindle. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In Drosophila, the Vihar E2 UBC contributes to the spatiotemporal 
      control of Cyclin B degradation that first occurs at the spindle poles. 
      APC/C-mediated proteolysis of Vihar E2-C autoinactivates the APC/C at the 
      centrosome before a second wave of proteolysis to degrade Cyclin B on the rest of 
      the spindle and elsewhere in the cell.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Morocco, diagnosis of HIV infection remains late, which seriously 
      compromises the timely management of HIV infection in the era of HAART therapies. 
      Rapid test represents a good opportunity to improve the access to early screening 
      of HIV. The objective of this study is to report the experience of the infectious 
      diseases unit of the Ibn Rochd University hospital center of Casablanca, in the 
      use of the rapid test in clinical screening of HIV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      retrospective study reports data relevant to the use of the rapid test Determine 
      VIH-1/2, Abbott Diagnostics, since its introduction in the infectious diseases 
      unit in April 2006 up to December 2009. The test was performed for patients from 
      the infectious diseases unit and patients hospitalized in different units of the 
      Ibn Rochd University hospital center, after their consent. Test was ordered 
      systematically by clinicians in case of any suspected symptom related to HIV and 
      immunodepression. Positive samples were confirmed by Western Blot test, at the 
      National Reference Laboratory for HIV, within the Institut National d'Hygiène in 
      Rabat. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2009, 1105 rapid tests were performed, among 
      which 16.3% were positive. All results were provided to patients and none were 
      lost to follow-up. The main reasons for the prescription of an HIV test were 
      tuberculosis (26.3%) and chronic diarrhea (9.9%) for inpatients. For outpatients, 
      the main symptoms were sexually transmissible infections (16.7%) and weight loss 
      (15.7%). Results of the tests allowed us to adapt the treatment in case of 
      suspicion of pneumocystosis (12 cases) and toxoplasmosis (seven cases). 
      CONCLUSION: The introduction of the rapid test for HIV clinical screening in the 
      hospital facilities improved considerably the access to diagnosis and 
      consequently allowed a timely management of HIV infection.

PG  - 657-60
AB  - Despite utilizing different actions to render blood safe for transfusions, we 
      continue to have the risk of transmitting some viral infections. For this reason, 
      it is important to determine prevalence of infections due to HIV and hepatitis B 
      and hepatitis C viruses in blood donors. Previous studies from Mexico indicate 
      that HIV prevalence is 0.01 to 0.13%, while it is 0.11 to 1.22% for hepatitis B, 
      and for hepatitis C, prevalence is 0.47 to 1.47%. We are checking the results of 
      the screening tests (ELISA 3rd generation and chemiluminescent immunoassays) from 
      blood donors studied at the Central Blood Bank (Banco Central de Sangre) at the 
      Mexican Institute of Social Security's (IMSS) Twentieth First Century National 
      Medical Center in Mexico City from 1995 to 2002. Reactive results were studied by 
      confirmatory tests, Western Blot for HIV, AgHBs neutralization test for hepatitis 
      B, and RIBA-HCV3.0 for hepatitis C. Reactive results from 513,062 blood donors 
      confirmed for HV were 0.07%, reactive results and confirmation of hepatitis B 
      from 511,733 blood donors were 0.13%, and reactive results and confirmation of 
      hepatitis C from 511,115 blood donors were 0.31%. Rates obtained are low when 
      compared with results of previous studies in Mexico for HIV, hepatitis B, and 
      hepatitis C. It may be possible than these low rates indicate the positive impact 
      obtained from preventive actions, better strategies of detection of blood donors 
      with high risk, and the advantage of working with a fully automated test system 
      with state-of-the-art technology.

AB  - In Bangui (Central African Republic) a survey started in 1986 for 2 years. 175 
      undernourished children and the mothers were surveyed. In this target group, a 
      high seroprevalence to HIV was determined (12 p.c. of the undernourished children 
      and 25 p.c. for the mothers.) It was also possible to put into light the 
      predictive signs of HIV1 infection in the undernourished people, to follow them 
      up clinically and to determine the sociocultural profile of the undernourished 
      child's mother. In fact, unmarried woman, incidentally prostitute. This is a 
      group at risk that has to be privileged within the control of HIV infection.

PG  - 37-41
AB  - HIV and HTLV-1 are retrovirus that can produce human disease. It is known that 
      HTLV-1 is associated to the adult T cell leukemia and to the spastic tropical 
      paraparesis. AIDS is now a pandemic infection and HTLV-1 has a high endemicity in 
      the Caribbean region and Japan, whereas the south of the United States has a low 
      endemicity. In Mexico there is little information on HTLV-1 incidence. In the 
      present work we looked for anti HTLV-1 antibodies in one hundred persons that 
      belong to the high risks AIDS population in the city of Monterrey, Mexico. We 
      found that 93 sera were positive for anti HIV antibodies in a ELISA test and 
      seven were negative. All 93 sera were also positive in the Western Blot assay. In 
      the confirmatory test two out of the seven negative sera were classified as 
      indeterminate and five as negative. We also included in this study 50 sera from 
      healthy control volunteers that did not belong to the high risk AIDS population 
      and resulted negative in the HIV and HTLV-1 test. Anti HTLV-1 antibodies were 
      determined by using an agglutination test with gelatin particles covered with 
      HTLV-1 and confirmed by a Western Blot assay. We found that only three sera 
      resulted positive in this agglutination test, but were negative by the Western 
      Blot technique.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determining the prevalence of HIV infection in patients suffering from 
      cutaneous disease in a national reference center in Colombia. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study of patients aged 18 or older, having cutaneous pathology 
      and no previous HIV diagnosis. The calculated sample size was 1,537 patients. A 
      confirmed case was defined as being that of a patient having positive results in 
      the ELISA and Western blot tests. Prevalence was the number of confirmed cases 
      divided by the total population. The associations were measured by using 
      prevalence ratio. RESULTS: 1,649 patients were enrolled in the study. Our 
      center's prevalence was 1.21 % (20 cases). Molluscum contagiosum and seborrheic 
      dermatitis were the diseases having the highest prevalence of HIV infection which 
      had not been previously diagnosed (3.91 % and 2.05 %, respectively). Molluscum 
      contagiosum and HIV infection prevalence ratio was 3.96 (p: 0.01562). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The risk of HIV infection in patients aged 18 or older suffering 
      from Molluscum contagiosum was nearly 4 times higher than the risk in patients 
      having other cutaneous pathologies.

TI  - [Prevalence of HIV-1, HIV-2 and HTLV-1 infections. Experience in a Parisian 
      center for sexually transmitted diseases].
PG  - 1747-50
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is, to a great extent, a sexually 
      transmitted disease (STD). Its diffusion among the heterosexual population is 
      still limited. STD treatment centres are particularly well organized to watch 
      this diffusion. At the STD centre of the Saint-Louis hospital, Paris, we 
      conducted a 6-week prospective study concerning the systematic detection of HIV-1 
      infection in 240 consecutive female out-patients in 1988, and in 504 male 
      out-patients in 1989. The results obtained were as follow: 5/240 women (2.1 
      percent) and 19/504 men (3.8 percent) were seropositive for HIV-1. Out of these 
      24 subjects, 15 did not know they were seropositive. Predictive factors for 
      seropositivity were male homosexuality, addiction to heroin and, in women, drug 
      addicts as sex partners. Altogether, 23 of the 24 seropositive subjects had the 
      classical risk factors for HIV-1 infection. None of the 744 subjects in this 
      study were HIV-2 seropositive, and only 1 out of 504 men was HTLV-1 seropositive. 
      We conclude that the prevalence of HIV-1 infection was high in our centre, and 
      this prompts us to suggest that the serological test should be proposed to all 
      out-patients and that patient's education and preventive measures should be 
      organized by STD centres, even though the infection is still limited to patients 
      at a particularly high risk (drug addicts, homosexuals, country of origin).

TI  - [A comparison of three screening strategies for prevention of perinatal HIV 
      infection in Colombia: a decision analysis model].
PG  - 256-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To apply decision analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness of three 
      strategies for HIV screening of pregnant women and to recommend the one most 
      appropriate for the health care system of Colombia. METHODS: An economic study 
      applying decision analysis to three types of HIV screening of expectant women: 
      voluntary, universal, and optional. All the women in Colombia with unknown HIV 
      status who were admitted for child birth were included. The study included all 
      the direct medical costs incurred from the time of testing through the first year 
      following delivery, according to the General System for Healthcare Social 
      Security. Cost-effectiveness ratio and the savings of each of the strategies were 
      compared. RESULTS: For every 10,000 women, the universal strategy detected five 
      cases more than the voluntary strategy and seven cases more than the optional. 
      The universal strategy carried a cost of approximately US$ 17 for each 
      HIV-positive newborn; that is, less than half of that of the voluntary strategy 
      (US$ 38) and less than the optional (US$ 24). According to the bifactorial 
      analysis, the universal screening strategy was less costly than the voluntary and 
      more effective than both of the others, regardless of prevalence, the 
      false-positive rate of each method, and the rate of maternal compliance with 
      screening. CONCLUSIONS: The screening strategy currently in use in Colombia is 
      more costly (in both the medium- and long-term), less effective, and less capable 
      of prevention, than the universal screening strategy. The recommendation to the 
      national health authorities of Colombia is to begin screening all pregnant women 
      for HIV infection using third-generation testing.

TI  - [HIV seroprevalence in the population treated in a hospital emergency department: 
      analysis by pooled batches of serum].
PG  - 73-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The current number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected 
      people is not known in Spain as there is no national registry. This study has 
      aimed to estimate the prevalence of HIV infection in the population treated in a 
      hospital emergency department (ER) as an epidemic and risk of exposure indicator 
      during healthcare activity and to assess the differences observed regarding 
      previous estimates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 
      all the sera received in the ER anonymously. The final size of the pools was 5 
      sera. HIV antibody screening was performed using the 4th generation ELFA 
      technique and confirmation was performed by Western Blot. RESULTS: Seven out of 
      the 270 pools made from 1,347 sera obtained were reactive. The individualized 
      analysis confirmed 6 sera to be positive and 1 serum to be false positive. The 
      observed prevalence was 0.52% (95% CI 0.10-0.94). Prevalence fell 0.87% in 
      comparison to the years 1990-1991, although this was not statistically 
      significant (p = 0.08). DISCUSSION: The implementation of HIV antibodies 
      detection through a system of pooled batches in samples collected in the ER make 
      it possible to assess the prevalence of infection with this virus, decreasing 
      costs with regard to individualized analysis of sera in both economic terms as 
      well as samples handling.

TI  - [Characterization of HIV-1 subtypes in Sfax, Tunisia].
PG  - 184-9
AB  - We studied HIV-1 subtypes in 20 patients, originating from Tunisia in 18 cases 
      and Libya in 2 other cases and seen in Regional Hospital of Sfax during 
      1993-1997. Among the 18 tunisian patients, 14 are infected by subtype B. Nine of 
      them are living in european countries and were probably infected by intravenous 
      drug and/or sexual route. The five other patients infected by subtype B 
      correspond to autochtonous cases: 3 patients were infected by their partner, 1 
      was infected by blood transfusion and the last one has had multiple sexual 
      partners. For another tunisian patient, serum cross-reacted with 2 peptides C and 
      B (C/B) corresponding to coinfection or subtype recombination. Two strains were 
      indeterminate by SSEIA. The last tunisian patient, contaminated in Libya, is 
      infected by a strain presenting cross-reactivity with subtype A and C (A/C). This 
      same strain was found in one libyan patient. The second libyan patient is 
      infected by subtype C. CONCLUSION: In Tunisia, we noted the frequency of HIV-1 
      subtype B, originating from european countries. But, the fear of other HIV-1 
      subtypes introduction and therefore, the emergency of new recombinants must 
      incite us to a greatest vigilance in survey of HIV-1 infection.

PG  - 531-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: To January 1991 thirteen cases of HIV-2 infection had been reported 
      in Spain. Paradoxically, neighboring countries, i.e. France and Portugal, have 
      reported more than one thousand cases, and are the most HIV-2 prevalent areas 
      outside West Africa. We report the results of a prospective, nationwide study on 
      the prevalence of HIV-2 infection conducted in Spain in 1991. In addition, an 
      evaluation of testing methodologies is made. METHODS: Sera collected from 8,073 
      individuals at high-risk for HIV infection were screened by a combined HIV-1 plus 
      HIV-2 ELISA. Reactive samples were further evaluated by three tests, as HIV-1 
      Western blot (WB), HIV-2 specific WB, and a synthetic peptide assay immuno-dot 
      (Pepti-lav, Pasteur). RESULTS: Fifteen (0.18%) individuals met criteria of HIV-2 
      infection in both specific WB and SPA. Four (27%) of them showed reactivity to 
      both HIV-1 and HIV-2, and the dual infection was confirmed by polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) in 2 out of 3 available samples. The SPA showed higher sensitivity 
      and specificity than WB in the diagnosis and distinction of HIV-1 and HIV-2 
      infections. CONCLUSIONS: To January 1992, 28 cases of HIV-2 infection have been 
      described in Spain. All but two were African immigrants. The first cases of HIV-1 
      plus HIV-2 coinfection have been identified. In HIV high-risk populations, SPA 
      may provide an excellent alternative to WB to confirm ELISA reactive samples.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research work intended to describe the characteristics and the 
      seroprevalence of some sexually transmitted diseases (STD), in men working in 
      bars where female commercial sex takes place. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study 
      included an evaluation of 171 males during 1993, who were employed in bars and 
      who were potentially at risk of contact with female commercial sex workers 
      (FCSW). A structured survey was conducted in order to collect information about 
      social, demographic and sexual behavior characteristics. Blood samples were also 
      obtained to test for antibodies against Treponema pallidum (RPR/FTA-ABS), human 
      immunodeficiency virus (VIH) (ELISA, Western blot), Herpes simplex virus type-2 
      (HSV-2) (Western blot) and the core antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (ELISA). 
      RESULTS: Test results showed low infection rates of HIV, T: pallidum and HBV: 0%, 
      2.4% and 1.8%, respectively. However, their HSV-2 infection proportion (32.4%) 
      was considered intermediate in comparison to the prevalence of FCSW from bars 
      (55.5%), to that found in heterosexual men (14.6%), and to proportions found in 
      women general population (29.3% and 17.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The men's age and a 
      history of sexual intercourse with FCSW were strong predictors of HSV-2 
      infection. These findings evidence a relationship between men working in bars and 
      FCSW in terms of STD transmission and show the need for preventive care directed 
      to this group.

PG  - 223-9
AB  - Among 770 Western blots for HIV-1 confirmation on sera from subjects at high risk 
      for HIV infection, 4.3% (33 cases) were indeterminate. Isolated, stable, 
      reproducible anti-gp 160 reactivity, highly suggestive of a nonspecific reaction, 
      was found in 16% of cases. There were three other probably nonspecific patterns 
      with anti-gp 160 and either anti-gp 41 or anti-gp 120 reactivities and thin, 
      atypical bands. Two patterns with anti-p24 and either anti-gp 160 or anti-gp 120 
      reactivities were consistent with HIV-1 seroconversion. Reactivity directed 
      solely against gag products was seen in 18% of cases. The repeat test, performed 
      in 16 cases, showed an identical pattern in 3 cases, a modified pattern in 3 
      cases, negative results in 9 cases, and seroconversion in 1 case. No case of 
      HIV-2 infection was detected. Indeterminate Western blot results reflect 
      nonspecific reactivity in most instances but should nevertheless lead to the 
      exclusion of technical artefacts, seroconversion, and HIV-2 infection.

TI  - [How to reduce the prevalence of HIV-positive blood donors].
PG  - 307-21
AB  - Despite abolishing the policy of giving the results of the serological test as a 
      way to promote blood donation, and also after improving the predonation 
      questionnaire, we still have a high prevalence of HIV positive blood donors. In 
      this paper we try to analyze, interviewing the HIV positive blood donors in our 
      Counselling Clinic from January 1995 to December 1996, why they were accepted. We 
      asked the HIV positive blood donors to fill a form with the following questions: 
      identification, kind and frequency of blood donation, HIV high risk behaviour, 
      awareness of predonation serological status, willingness toward blood donation, 
      awareness of how dangerous the transfusion of HIV contaminated blood is. For the 
      screening we used Abbott HIV1/HIV 3rd generation plus EIA, test and HIV-1 Western 
      Blot Cambridge, Biotest, Worcester MA, for confirmatory assays. During the 
      evaluation period, 53,338 blood donors were attended, 130 (0.24%) were confirmed 
      HIV positive. Only 18/130 (13.84%) assisted to the Counselling Clinic. The mean 
      age was 33.27 +/- 5.35 years old, all males, 15 singles and 3 with stable 
      couples. 6/18 (33.33%) could have been discarded because of physical appearance 
      or because of theirs jobs. "Voluntary Donation" was higher than in the control 
      group (p = 0.0001). Homo/bisexual and promiscuous behaviour (p = 0.0003) were the 
      predominant high risk factors, in this group 55.55% had more than one risk 
      factor. The association with HBV and syphilis was high (p = 0.0001 and p = 
      0.0005). 5/18 (27.77%) knew they were HIV positive; 3/18 (16.66%) had the 
      suspicion they were HIV positive and 10/18 (55.55%) did not know it; however the 
      risk factors were the same in those groups. In the knew/suspicion group the main 
      reasons for blood donation were: Performing the test once more, 6; failure in the 
      predonation questionnaire, 1; family pressure, 1. In the group that ignored their 
      HIV positivity: ignorance of belonging to a high-risk group, 6; lack of 
      confidence in the interviewer, 3 and failure in the predonation questionnaire, 1. 
      61.11% knew that the HIV tests were performed on all blood donations and the the 
      positive ones were discarded. No one had knowledge of the window period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: 1. It is necessary to spread more information to the general 
      population about the ways of HIV transmission, the risk factors and its 
      prevention. 2. To make aware all HIV positive or those that suspect they are the 
      HIV positive how dangerous their blood donation could be. 3. Offering the general 
      population a free HIV test and giving the appropriate counselling and support. 4. 
      Improving the questionnaire, assuring that the blood donor could understand the 
      real meaning of the questions and how important his/her truthfulness is. 5. To 
      consider the implementation of the p24 antigen test as mandatory to all blood 
      donations and all the new techniques to avoid HIV transmission. 6. To change the 
      "related" blood donors to the true voluntary, altruistic, blood donor.

AB  - This study to evaluate the performance of eight diagnostic tests for HIV/AIDS 
      infection was conducted at the National Reference Center for HIV/AIDS/STD in 
      Lomé, Togo. The tests were as follows: Enzymum test anti HIV Combi, Enzymum tests 
      anti-HIV1 + 2 + subtype O, Genscreen HIV 1/2, Ice 1.0.2, Vironostika HIV Uni-Form 
      II Plus O, Genie II HIV 1/2, SFD HIV 1/2 PA and DETERMINE HIV 1/2. A total of 238 
      serum specimens collected consecutively between January and April 1999 were 
      studied. They were from 161 occasional blood donors and 77 patients. New Lav-Blot 
      I and Ii (western blot) were used as reference tests. Test sensitivity ranged 
      from 90 to 100%. Specificity ranged from 96 to 100%. The Enzymum test anti HIV 
      Combi used only on serum samples from blood donors demonstrated a sensitivity and 
      specificity of 100%. Tests based on Elisa (Emzymum Combi, Enzymum HIV 1 + 2 + 
      subtype O, Genscreen, Ice 1.0.2 and Vironostika) allowed acceptable diagnosis of 
      HIV/AIDS as alternatives to western blot. Two of the three rapid assays tested 
      provided acceptable results, i.e., Genie II HIV 1/2 and SFD HIV 1/2. They are 
      suitable for screening to prevent HIV transmission by blood transfusion in areas 
      where Elisa is unfeasible.

AB  - The rate of mother-to-infant transmission of the HIV approximates 20%. Early 
      treatment and monitoring of infected infants are feasible only if diagnosis is 
      established promptly. Diagnosis at birth relies on techniques that demonstrate 
      presence of the virus (viral cultures, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
      antigenemia). However, beyond six months of age, detection of evidence of an 
      immune response to the virus can also be used (anti-HIV IgA, in vitro production 
      of antibodies: ELISPOT or in vitro antibody production (IVAP). In practice, it 
      should be borne in mind that the sensitivity of each technique varies with age.

AB  - One hundred forty human sera distributed in 2 groups were analyzed. In group I, 
      50 serum samples from healthy individuals that did not belong to the high-risk 
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) population were included. In group II, 
      there were 90 individuals, most of whom were apparently healthy but were at high 
      risk of getting AIDS through their life styles or by transfusion. Of the 90 
      persons, 5 had a clinical picture of AIDS. All sera were analyzed by the enzyme - 
      linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the anti VIH antibodies. The positive 
      cases were confirmed by the Western blot assay. In all samples the presence of 
      the human immune deficiency virus antigens was sought. The results showed that 
      the 50 healthy individuals (control group) were negative for both HIV antigens 
      and antibodies. Of the 90 sera for the high-risk group, 50 were negative for 
      antibodies, and 2 of them (4%) were positive for HIV antigens. Forty sera were 
      positive for anti HIV antibody and among them, 5 patients were diagnosed as AIDS, 
      and showed positive for antigen and antibody. The other 35 patients were all 
      positive for HIV antibody and in 8 of them HIV antigen was also present.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the changes in the spectrum of HIV-positive blood donors 
      along seven years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The municipal Blood Bank of Caracas 
      Federal District examined 193,796 blood donors between 1986 and 1992. Anti-HIV 
      antibodies were determined by the following methods: Ortho HIV-Elisa Test System 
      (59.5% of the samples), Abbott Recombinant HIV-EIA (28.6%), Vironostika HIV 
      Microelisa System-Organon Teknika (2.1%), Bio-Test anti-HIV Recombinant Elisa 
      (2.1%), and Recombigen (env and gag) HIV Cambridge Biotech (7.7%). Results 
      confirmation was performed with Biotech/Dupont HIV-I Western Blot Kit, Chiron 
      Riba HIV 216 Test System and Inno-Lia HIV 1/2 Ab immunogenetics SA. RESULTS: Slow 
      but progressive increase of positive results was seen in the blood donors along 
      the years, from 0.05% in 1986 to 0.31% in 1992. Higher prevalence was seen in 
      males (p < 0.001), although absolute increase in the number of positive females 
      was found by 1992 (p < 0.05). According to their type, 80.6% of the donors were 
      patient-related (RD), 13% attended mobile blood-drawing units (MU) and 6.4% were 
      VD (p < 0.001), with a trend to increase amongst DR and decrease amongst MV. The 
      majority of the positive donors pertained to homo-or bisexuals (60.5%), although 
      they showed progressive decrease, whereas the positive findings increased in the 
      promiscuous heterosexual group and amongst those having contacts with persons at 
      risk. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of HIV-positive donors is found, the expected 
      figure for 1995 being 0.37% if the present trends are maintained. Thus, a better 
      selection of blood donors is recommended by means of careful enquiries, the use 
      of optimal reagents capable of shortening the window period, deferring people at 
      risk from blood donation, and promoting altruistic voluntary donation of blood.

AB  - Serum HIV antibodies has been investigated in different subpopulation from four 
      different regions in Zäire by Elisa (Elavia Pasteur) and Western Blot. 
      Seropositive prevalence differed from 2.4% (rural population) to 12.5% (urban 
      population) according to the regions. When the group with 2.4% migrated to the 
      area with 12.5% positives, after 8-12 months the number of seropositives in this 
      group raised to 8%, showing an increase of 5.6% within one year. Such population 
      is suitable for a large scale clinical trial (with anti-AIDS vaccine) to be 
      performed on individuals with high risk of natural infection.

OAB - Major obstacles to development of a vaccine against the HIV infection have 
      apparently been resolved by utilizing viral signals not directly from the virus 
      or its products, but from membranes of infected cells. Evaluation of the level of 
      protection provided by the vaccine requires a large scale clinical trial in a 
      population with a high rate of infection. Screening studies have been conducted 
      in different areas and in different subgroups in Zaire in order to identify such 
      a group. A population living or working at a site some 30 km east of Kinshasa was 
      studied between December 1986-March 1988, and a parallel study was conducted of 
      persons residing in Kinshasa. Groups from 2 rural regions were also studied. The 
      1554 persons screened were divided into 8 groups based on their residence 
      histories. Serum HIV antibodies were assessed by ELISA and Western Blot. The 4 
      groups composed of men living and working in Kinshasa or within a suburban radius 
      of 30 km had a seroprevalence rate of 12.67%, with no significant difference by 
      residence. A population of 136 pregnant women in the same locations had a 
      seroprevalence rate of 12.5%, for a sex ratio of 1.1. A group of 71 persons 
      studied in a provincial city of southern Zaire who had spent time in Kinshasa 
      several years previously had a seroprevalence of 4.23%. A group of new arrivals 
      to the Kinshasa vicinity from the provinces who had never previously resided in 
      Kinshasa had a seroprevalence of 2.45%. The final group was also composed of new 
      arrivals from the same provinces with no previous urban experience. Screening 
      after 8-12 months in the city showed that their seropositive rate had increased 
      from 2.45% to 8.00%. This increase of 5.6% within 1 year indicates that this 
      group would be appropriate for a large scale clinical trial on individuals with 
      high risk of natural infection.

AB  - Studies on sexually transmitted diseases (STD) during the previous years in 
      Mexico are discussed. The information sources were: a) Surveys among commercial 
      sex workers. Since 1990, 1,386 women have been studied in four federal states 
      through structured questionnaires and laboratory tests. Prevalence of different 
      STD's has been significant (syphilis (VDRL, FTA-abs) 23.7%; chlamydiosis (Ag IF) 
      12.9%; gonorrhea (Ag, ELISA) 11.5%; anti-HBs 11.0%; herpes 1,2 (IgM) 9.3%, HBsAg 
      5.7%. Frequency of HIV (ELISA, Western blot) has been low; 0.5%. In 1994, 662 
      women were studied in Mexico City, with different laboratory techniques for 
      chlamydiosis and gonorrhea (culture), hepatitis B (anticore antibodies) and 
      herpes (total antibodies) with the following results: syphilis 1.5-12%; 
      chlamydiosis 10.8-11.7%; gonorrhea 0-5.9%; hepatitis B 0-7.1%; herpes 44.7-78%; 
      and HIV 0-1.4%. b) Surveys among men with homosexual and bisexual practices. 325 
      subjects have been studied in three federal states using methods similar to those 
      of the 1990 survey. Contrasting with results among women, HIV prevalence was 
      found to be high; (18.8%), and considerable for other STD's: anti-HBsAg 28.6%, 
      syphilis 34.9%, recent herpes 10.9%, HBsAg 5.0%, chlamydiosis (Ag, IF) 4.3%, 
      herpes simplex 1,2 (Ag, IF) 4.7%, gonorrhea (Ag, ELISA) 2.8%. c) Patient clinical 
      studies. The clinical interrelationship between different STD and HIV infection 
      has been studied; clinical differences are described between patients with 
      condylomata or syphilis depending on HIV serostatus. Implications of the 
      interrelationship between different STD's and HIV infection for the prevention 
      and control of these diseases are discussed.

PG  - 65-7
AB  - Herpes-zoster is commonly observed in immunodepressed patients with HIV infection 
      in Africa. It is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. Varicella 
      which is usually considered as the acute invasive phase of infection can recur in 
      the same subject during immunodepression, thus constituting recurrent varicella. 
      Little information is available concerning recurrent varicella in Africa. The 
      purpose of the present report is to describe 10 cases observed in 9 adults and 1 
      child in Lomé, Togo. In 6 cases recurrence of varicella allowed diagnosis of HIV 
      infection. Clinical symptoms were severe with widespread lesions and 
      fever-related changes in general status. Nine of the 10 patients required 
      hospitalization. In all cases the illness lasted more than 3 weeks. This series 
      demonstrates that varicella in adults can be the first clinical manifestation of 
      HIV infection in tropical areas and that this possibility should be investigated 
      especially if varicella is recurrent.

AB  - A pilot study was carried out in order to evaluate the feasibility of determining 
      the seroprevalence rate of HIV infection and the prevalence of risk factors among 
      selected hospital patients at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois 
      (CHUV). Consent was obtained and only blood already obtained for other purposes 
      was used for testing. Among 850 patients between 16 and 65 years of age and 
      residing in Switzerland who were originally selected at random, only 200 patients 
      were accessible for an interview and for whom blood was available in order to be 
      included in the study. Of these, 165 (83%) accepted their blood to be tested. A 
      seropositive result was identified in 2 patients already aware of their 
      serostatus. The age distribution, diagnosis and behavioral risk factors (when 
      available through the interview) were not different among those accepting the 
      test and the ones refusing. However, foreigners were more likely to refuse the 
      blood test than Swiss nationals, even though none of them came from a country 
      with a high rate of endemicity for HIV infection. Reasons for refusal included 
      the following: lack of risk factors 10 (29%), doubts about confidentiality 6 
      (17%), blood test already performed 5 (14%), language barrier 4 (11%) and others 
      10 (29%). We conclude that even though the data in our sample did not suggest 
      that patients refusing the test were at an increased risk of being seropositive, 
      it is unlikely that with such a refusal rate, a reliable measure of 
      seroprevalence could be determined in the population of study with the methods 
      used, especially when one is expecting a relatively low seroprevalence rate.

      seeking HIV screening].
PG  - 5-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the seroprevalence of syphilis, herpes simplex-2, hepatitis 
      B and HIV, and main sociodemographic characteristics and sexual behavior in women 
      seeking testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Mexico City. 
      METHODOLOGY: A self-applied questionnaire was used in 454 women; and a blood 
      sample was taken for the detection of markers for syphilis, herpes simplex 
      virus-2 (HSV-2)), antibodies against core and surface antigens for hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV), and ELISA and Western blot for HIV. RESULTS: Seroprevalences for 
      antibodies against T. pallidum, HSV-2, HBV and HIV were 4.6%, 29.3%, 3.5% and 
      4.0%, respectively. Forty-six percent of the women were 20 to 29 years old; 70% 
      reported complete junior high school or higher education level; 75% were sexually 
      active; 56% reported at least one stable male sexual partner, 17% reported at 
      least one occasional male sexual partner in the last three months, and 60% had 
      had at least one sexual relation in the last three months; of these, only 18% (n 
      = 82) reported the use of a condom as a preventive measure. Almost 30% of the HIV 
      positive women had a history of blood transfusion, while less than 10% of the HIV 
      negative women had received a transfusion. In addition, 10.6% said that one of 
      their sexual partners was infected with HIV or had AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of 
      HIV/STD transmission for this group of self-selected women were linked to blood 
      transfusion, low education and, most important, the risk from male sexual 
      partners who were HIV seropositive. It is expected that these results will 
      contribute to the improvement and development of strategies for the control and 
      prevention of STD among this population group, as well as the general population 
      in Mexico.

AB  - We tested 98 sera from HIV-2-infected patients for cross-reactivity with HIV-1 
      antigens in a competitive EIA test and western blotting. The sera were obtained 
      during epidemiological surveys in Cape Verde Islands (n = 47) and Mali (n = 51). 
      There were significantly more cross reactions with sera from Mali. Similar 
      results were obtained with sera from African patients resident in France. Samples 
      from HIV-2-infected patients from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Mali were 
      more often reactive with HIV-1 antigens than were those from HIV-2-infected 
      patients from the western Atlantic coast (Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Senegal). 
      These data underline the importance of using specific tests for HIV-2 
      sero-positivity, and the need to include a panel of HIV-2-positive sera of 
      different geographic origins in quality control kits.

PG  - 983-90
AB  - In order to better understand the role of the immunodominant V3 loop in the 
      type-specific immune response and also to determine if this sequence has a role 
      in AIDS pathogenesis, notably in the induction of apoptosis in CD4+ cells, we 
      have introduced 2 modifications in the env gene from pNL4-3: a partial deletion 
      in the V3 loop, keeping only the conserved tip of the loop GPGRAF consensus 
      sequence (env delta V3-GPGRAF) and, secondly, a complete deletion of V3 sequence 
      plus 43 nucleotides in C3 (env delta V3+). These constructions as well as the 
      non-modified env gene, were cloned and expressed in a baculovirus system. Western 
      blot analysis has shown that both modified env gene products reacted with a 
      reference anti-HIV-1 serum to the same extent as the non-modified gp 160. 
      However, in contrast to the non-modified env-protein and to env delta V3-GPGRAF, 
      the env delta V3+ protein failed to bind to CD4 molecule, although V3 is not 
      directly involved in receptor binding. These modified and non-modified 
      recombinant proteins will be very useful to determine the potential of the 
      partially or totally V3-deleted gp 160 to induce broadly reactive neutralizing 
      antibodies and also to determine if V3 has a role in certain aspects of 
      HIV-induced pathogenesis, notably apoptosis.

TI  - [Virologic diagnosis of HIV infection in the pregnant woman and newborn infant].
PG  - 99-103
AB  - The virological diagnosis of HIV infection in pregnant women mainly consists of 
      detecting antibodies to structural viral antigens. The difficulty lies more in 
      the interpretation of the confirmatory assay than in technical problems. The 
      result is critical since the continuation or interruption of pregnancy is 
      dependent upon it. The diagnosis of HIV infection in newborns has been hampered 
      by the presence of passively acquired maternal antibodies. The diagnosis at birth 
      therefore must include culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells for virus 
      isolation and detection of serum antigen. However, due to the difficulty or lack 
      of sensitivity of these tests new diagnostic procedures, such as the polymerase 
      chain reaction, must be developed to improve the accuracy of the early diagnosis. 
      Such new approaches must be evaluated very carefully before being introduced in 
      routine diagnosis.

TI  - [Report of the first 2 cases of HIV-1 group O infection in Spain].
PG  - 418-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The wide genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates has allowed to 
      classify them into several subtypes. Very high divergent strains have been 
      isolated recently from West Africa patients with AIDS, and they have been called 
      HIV-1 group O ("outlier"). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In April 1995 a couple of 
      patients was referred for medical follow-up and definitive diagnosis of HIV-1 
      infection. Both were white and had been born in Spain. The husband had been 
      working for 10 years in West Africa. CD4+ T-cell counts were below 250 x 10(6)/l 
      in both subjects, and the wife had developed seborrheic dermatitis and mild 
      pancytopenia. Serologic and genetic studies were performed to study the presence 
      of HIV-1 group O infection in this couple. RESULTS: Serological tests (enzyme 
      immunoassays, Western blot, line immunoassay) yielded indeterminate results for 
      HIV-1 testing serum from the wife, but the husband's specimen was positive. 
      Serological test for HIV-2 were negative in both subjects. In contrast, a new 
      test allowed recognition of specific antibodies to HIV-1 group O in these 
      patients. Furthermore, this infection was confirmed using a discriminative PCR 
      methodology, which demonstrated the presence of specific HIV-1 group O sequences 
      and the absence of group M sequences. CONCLUSIONS: The first two cases of HIV-1 
      group O infection in Spain are described. It is pointed that diagnostic tests and 
      therapeutic strategies need to considers the presence of this new HIV variant 
      outside endemic areas.

AB  - We described an 18 old homosexual man who after 5 days developed a neurologic 
      picture associated with Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) seroconversion. The 
      patient had developed a dissociative psychiatric disorder 6 months before, and 
      after resolution of the acute neurologic disease a mild neuro-psychiatric 
      disorder remained. After mononucleosis-like syndrome of three weeks, the patient 
      developed a meningo-encephalitic process 48 h post admission. He evolved with 
      tonic seizures and twilight state and was admitted into Intensive Care Unit 
      because of epileptic status and deep coma. Evolution was favourable after 72 h of 
      treatment with acyclovir and antiepileptic drugs. Laboratory data showed an 
      inverted T4/T8 ratio and seroconversion to HIV-antibodies and p24-antigen both in 
      serum and CSF. These observations confirm the existence of psychiatric as well 
      neurological alterations in acute HIV infection, and also the significance of 
      p24-antigen and Western-Blot in serum and CSF in showing the seroconversion 
      profile.

TI  - [Acute symptomatic HIV infection. Report of 10 cases].
PG  - 205-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of acute HIV infection must rely in the demonstration 
      of a significant increase in antibody titers against HIV together with the timely 
      development of clinical symptoms. The percentage of cases with symptomatic acute 
      HIV infection is currently unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review 
      of all patients admitted to Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases department 
      of a General Hospital in a three-year period. The presence of HIV-antibodies was 
      assessed by means of ELISA, indirect immunofluorescent test and Western blot 
      technique. RESULTS: Among a total number of 1110 patients, we found 10 (0.9%) 
      that were considered as having an acute symptomatic HIV infection. Clinical 
      presentation was as follows: mononucleosis-like syndrome, 7 patients; aseptic 
      meningitis, 1 patient; polirradiculoneurophaty and coreoatetosis, 1 patient and 
      esophageal candidiasis, 1 patient. Transmission of infection was heterosexual 
      contact in 60% of cases. Four patients developed a transient skin rash, four had 
      oral candidiasis and low platelet count was detected in 6 cases. The presence of 
      circulating HIV antigen could be demonstrated in 7 patients, and the change in 
      antibody titer was recorded with an 11 +/- 2 weeks span. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      incidence of symptomatic HIV acute infection was only 0.9% in our study. The high 
      number of patients with heterosexual transmission and low platelet counts in our 
      series is remarkable.

AB  - The presence of antibodies against the HIV protein of 24 kd was studies by the 
      parallel use of the DAVIH BLOT western blot and of the DAVIH AC P24 ELISA in 
      serum samples from 176 patients at different HIV-1 infection stages. The results 
      were correlated with the clinical classification of the patient at the moment of 
      taking the sample and with the further evolution during 6 months. 57% of the 
      patients with opportunistic minor infections and 96% of AIDS patients had low 
      antibodies titres. Dead patients showed no reactivity or presented very low 
      titres in samples taken before dying. Different titrations were observed in serum 
      groups with an apparently uniform reactivity in the western blot. The results 
      show and adequate clinical and serological correlation. Therefore, the DAVIH AC 
      P24 ELISA could be useful in the clinical follow-up of HIV-1 infected persons.

      1991].
PG  - 51-6
AB  - The authors make out a statement about HIV infection in French Polynesia at the 
      date of 1991 December 31. 96 cases all together of seropositive and AIDS infected 
      people were recorded. These patients are young generally (78 p.c. between 21 and 
      40 years old) sexually contaminated (72 out of 96) and live in Tahiti island (94 
      p.c.). Sex-ratio is 2.8 male/1 female. Among them, we noted 55 p.c. of Europeans, 
      38 p.c. of Polynesians and 7 p.c. of Asiatic people. Epidemiological monitoring 
      of the infection was made easy because of a set of laws and possibilities of 
      detection highly favourable. Progress of the infection is constant, with 20 new 
      cases detected each year with a prevalence of 150 cases of AIDS per 1 million of 
      inhabitants, French Polynesia could be classified as the 5th or 6th region of 
      France as far as the importance of the disease. Clinical, biological and 
      epidemiological taking of charge of patients is detailed as well as the 
      prevention campaign.

OAB - Serological surveillance of HIV infection in accordance with World Health 
      Organization guidelines has taken place in French Polynesia since 1985. 20,000 
      tests are conducted annually in a population not exceeding 200,000. 30% of tests 
      are among blood donors. An average of 20 new cases of HIV infection are diagnosed 
      each year. A total of 96 cases of HIV infection or AIDS were reported to the 
      public health authorities between 1985 and December 31, 1990. 78% of the 96 
      persons were aged 21-40 years. The sex ratio was 2.8 men per woman. 55% were in 
      Europeans (53 cases among 24,000 European residents), and 7% were in Asians (7 
      cases among 10,000 Asians). 94% of the patients were inhabitants of Tahiti. 44 of 
      the 96 patients were male homosexuals or bisexuals, 18 were heterosexuals with 
      multiple partners, 13 received transfusions before 1985, 10 were sex partners of 
      seropositive persons, 9 were former addicts, 1 was the infant of an infected 
      mother, and 1 had no known risk factor. ELISA tests were conducted in 6 different 
      laboratories in the island of Tahiti, with confirmation by Western blot at the 
      laboratory of the Louis Mallarde Territorial Medical Research Institute. Contacts 
      are traced and tested, and seropositive individuals are followed regularly, with 
      consultations at 6 month intervals for seropositive persons. Of the 46 patients 
      present in the territory as of December 1990, 36 were at stage 1, 2 at stage 2, 5 
      at stage 3, and 3 at stage 4 according to the World Health Organization 
      guidelines. 20 of the other 50 had died and 30 left the territory.

TI  - [Consistency of HIV/AIDS transmission categories reported by the epidemiological 
      surveillance of Chiapas State, Mexico: a problem of method].
PG  - 401-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the mechanisms of HIV/AIDS transmission reported by the 
      epidemiological surveillance system information of the Chiapas State and those 
      referred by HIV positive men interviewed in the Soconusco's region from the same 
      state. METHODS: Databases containing information about the HIV/AIDS cases 
      registered in the State of Chiapas and in the Soconusco's region were used. 
      Additionally, 32 men previously detected as HIVpositive by the regional 
      surveillance system answered a questionnaire about their sexual behavior and some 
      socio-demographic characteristics. All participants provided a blood sample to 
      identify antibodies against HIVusing two screening tests, ELISA and 
      microagglutination, and one confirmatory test by Western blot. RESULTS: While the 
      heterosexual transmission was predominant among HIV/AIDS cases reported by the 
      epidemiological surveillance of Chiapas State and the Soconusco's (50.4% and 69. 
      40%, respectively), heterosexual transmission among the interviewed individuals 
      was 36.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the proposal about a process of 
      "heterosexualization" of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Chiapas State and particularly in 
      the Soconusco's region, the present study suggest that homosexual and bisexual 
      behavior continue to be the main routes of HIV transmission among men. These 
      results also suggest the presence of a methodological limitation in the 
      evaluation of sexual behavior among HIV-seropositive individuals in the region. A 
      gender analysis about masculinity, would allow a better understanding ofthe 
      social and cultural aspects of sexuality that are not evident when only the 
      sexual practices are evaluated.

PG  - 111-4
AB  - The lack of expensive equipment and well-trained laboratory technicians in 
      developing countries makes it difficult to use standard methods (2 EIA confirmed 
      by western blotting) to diagnose HIV infection. This led the WHO to develop 
      simplified algorithms based on sequential screening tests, with no confirmation 
      by immunoblotting. These algorithms were tested in the normal diagnosis 
      conditions of a medical unit in Maputo, Mozambique. We tested 402 sera, collected 
      with the consent of the patients concerned. The sera were first tested for HIV 
      according to French regulations (2 EIA with western blot if at least one EIA was 
      positive). This strategy identified 53 sera as positive for HIV1 and 1 serum as 
      positive for HIV2. We then tested who algorithms, one for a predicted rate of 
      prevalence < 10% and the other for a predicted rate of prevalence > 10%. Neither 
      algorithm performed adequately for diagnostic purposes. Further evaluation with a 
      panel of local sera is required to select the most suitable algorithm in terms of 
      specificity and sensitivity, and algorithms should be throughly tested before 
      inclusion in national AIDS control strategies.

PG  - 283-7
AB  - The epidemiologic and sociodemographic characteristics of human deficiency virus 
      (HIV) infection vary from one country to another. The objective of this study was 
      to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in pregnant women in Dakar and 
      associated factors. Systematic anonymous screening was performed in pregnant 
      women admitted to the maternity ward. Women whose seropositivity was confirmed by 
      Western blot retroviral serology were included. One woman out of four was 
      assigned by simple random selection to the case control group. Over a 24 month 
      period, 12,498 women were tested. 104 were seropositive (44 HIV1, 58HIV2, and 2 
      HIV1-HIV2 giving a prevalence of 0.8%. Factors associated with HIV1 and HIV2 were 
      different: mean age 21.7 years for HIV1 versus 30.6 for HIV 2 (p = 0.05); origin 
      in Guinea-Bissau for HIV2 (p = 0.001); mean number of pregnancies 2.6 for HIV1 
      versus 5.9 for HIV2 (p = 0.001); mean parity 1.5 for HIV1 versus 4.5 for HIV2 (p 
      < 0.01); vitality of the conception product in 85.1% for HIV2 versus 67.5% for 
      HIV1 (p = 0.0001). These data confirm the low prevalence of HIV infection in 
      pregnant women, with a predominance for HIV2. The factors identified in 
      associated with virus type suggest a different mode of transmission and/or 
      reduced virulence or HIV2 compared with HIV1. Knowledge of these factors helps 
      orient management strategies, especially in pregnant women.

PG  - 434-7
AB  - The effectiveness of different methodologies to identify antigenemia and 
      antibodies against HIV at the time of viral primary infection was evaluated. To 
      this end, 6 consecutive serum samples of a patient who had had symptomatic 
      seroconversion were assessed. The detection of antigenemia was earlier than that 
      of antibodies, although the sensitivity of the three evaluated assays varied 
      greatly. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) designed with synthetic peptides from the 
      HIV envelope (third generation EIA) was the most sensitive test for antibody 
      detection. Five other tests elaborated with antigenic material from a viral 
      lysate (first generation) or with recombinant proteins (second generation) were 
      reactive later, although the second generation EIA were more sensitive. A rapid 
      immunofiltration test (HIV-Check) had good sensitivity, similar to that of the 
      second generation EIA. Western blotting (WB) identified antibodies against the 
      viral core later than the third generation EIA, and all the bands required for 
      the diagnosis only appeared three weeks later. Therefore, although WB is an 
      excellent method to confirm results from other tests, it may not be definitive 
      for the results at the primary infection period when other particularly sensitive 
      techniques are already diagnostic. We think that the higher sensitivity of EIA 
      tests using synthetic peptides justifies its generalization for sample screening 
      in blood banks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of serological markers for the human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HVB) and C (HCV) viruses, and 
      Treponema pallidum in blood donors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of the 
      screening tests from blood donors studied at the Central Blood Bank of the 
      Ignacio Garcia Tellez National Medical Center, in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico between 
      January 2002 and December 2004, have been retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Of 
      39,933 blood donors, 424 (1.06%) were positive to one or more serological 
      markers. The seropositivity rates for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HCV and 
      anti-Treponema pallidum were found as 0.13%, 0.20%, 0.44% and 0.29%, 
      respectively. Western Blot positive was found in 41 (77.36%) of the 53 blood 
      donors positive for anti-HIV. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the prevalence of 
      serological markers was similar or lower than that reported in previous studies 
      in Mexico.

AB  - We carried out this study to assess the prevalence of co-infection with hepatitis 
      B and HIV-1 in african pregnant women. Nine hundred and seventeen pregnant women 
      attending two antenatal clinics in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, were included. 
      The characteristics of the women were the following: a mean age of 26 years and 
      83.5% married; a mean gravidity and para of 4 and 3 respectively and a mean 
      gestational age of 27 weeks of amenorrhea. Then sera were drawn to be tested for 
      both hepatitis B and HIV-1. Sera tested positive for HIV-1 at ELISA were 
      confirmed by Western Blot. Ninety eight women (10.7%) were Ag HBs carriers of 
      whose 18.2% were positive for Ag HBe, 66.7% anti-HBe positive and 95.6% anti-HBc 
      positive. The HIV-1 prevalence rate was 5.9%. Eight women were positive for both 
      Ag HBs and HIV-1, giving a co-infection rate of 0.88%. The co-infection rate by 
      hepatitis B and HIV-1 is very low in pregnant women in Bobo Dioulasso despite a 
      high prevalence of these two infections.

AB  - Since 1991 AIDS and HIV infection in the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros 
      have been monitored through a network of sentinel sites including predetermined 
      target populations. In all cases seropositivity for HIV was confirmed by western 
      blotting after two ELISA screening tests. AIDS was diagnosed on Bangui clinical 
      criteria and positive western blotting results. As of June 30, 1996, the 
      cumulative number of AIDS cases reported to the World Health Organization was 7 
      for a prevalence of 1.4 per 100000 inhabitants. The prevalence of HIV antibodies 
      has remained at less than 1% in target populations, i.e. women undergoing 
      prenatal examinations, patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis, blood donors, 
      and patients presenting sexually transmitted diseases (STD). This low stable 
      prevalence rate which is similar to those reported in other Indian Ocean 
      countries is in sharp contrast with the high incidence of syphilis and STD in the 
      region.

PG  - 278-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the HIV seroprevalence in Mexican blood donors and the 
      residual risk of transfusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The seroprevalence was 
      determined in a sample of first-time blood donors at one hospital center in 
      Mexico City, from 2003 to 2007. To estimate the seroprevalence reported in 
      Mexican blood donors, we reviewed recent papers. To determine the positive 
      likelihood ratio (LR+) of the EIA test the specificity was calculated against the 
      western-blot result. To infer the residual risk, the incident infections were 
      assumed to be 1.8 times more frequent for first-time donors. RESULTS: We analyzed 
      29,318 donors; 66 were reactive to HIV by EIA (225/100,000; 95% Confidence 
      Interval: 171 to 279/100,000), but western-blot confirmed only 5 (prevalence = 
      17/100,000 donors; 95% CI: 2 to 32/100,000). The maximal residual risk was 
      inferred to be 6.2 per million, or about 6.8 per year. The LR+ of the EIA test 
      was calculated to be 476. The Bayesian analysis estimated that the disease is 
      present in only 7.5% donors with a reactive EIA. Published reports in medical 
      literature do not inform confirmatory tests for Mexican donors. DISCUSSION: The 
      residual risk for HIV had been calculated to be about 100 per million of blood 
      donors. Although we inferred that the risk had been overestimated by not 
      performing confirmatory tests, the results are a call for action as the risk is 
      still several times higher than the one reported in industrialized countries.

TI  - [Abdominal echography in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
      infection. Diagnostic usefulness in the evaluation of associated medico-surgical 
      pathology].
PG  - 115-21
AB  - BASIS: The abdominal manifestations in the patient with HIV infection are 
      increasingly frequent. We have conducted the present study in order to determine 
      the diagnostic usefulness of the abdominal echography in the clinical assessment 
      of the patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We review the echographic findings of 112 
      patients carrying the HIV with or without the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 
      (AIDS). Seventy eight patients were men and 34, women, with an average age of 30 
      years. The main risk group was parenterally drug addiction (72%). The stage of 
      the HIV infection was IVC1 in 41% of the cases, II in 23%, III in 13% and IVC2 in 
      13%. The echographic exploration was performed using a real-time echography, with 
      a probe of 3.5 Mhz, assessing according to conventional criteria the abdominal 
      organs and their pathology, masses and free intraabdominal fluid. The echographic 
      characteristics were first broadly assessed in the patients from the series and 
      later on, according to the patient's pathology. (Infectious, acute abdominal, 
      hepatic biochemical disorders, HIV carrier-associated pathology). RESULTS: In 33% 
      of the cases, the echography was normal. Hepatomegaly was the most frequent 
      echographic sign: 56 patients (50%), followed by splenomegaly in 43 patients 
      (38.3%), standing out the affection of the biliary and/or vesicular ductus in 7 
      patients (6.2%). The echographic findings were not related to the HIV infection 
      stage, nor with the presence of hepatic biochemical disorders. However, the 
      presence of organomegaly (hepatosplenomegaly associated or not to retroperitoneal 
      adenopathies) were more frequent in the group with infectious complication, 33.3% 
      vs 19.6% (p < 0.01), that in the patients without associated infectious 
      processes. In patients with medical or surgical acute abdominal pathology, the 
      echography was diagnostic in 9 out of 10 patients. CONCLUSION: In the HIV 
      patient, the echography allows an specific initial diagnostic assessment, being 
      able in most of the patients with abdominal manifestations to diagnose the causal 
      pathology.

AB  - Since 1990 within the framework of a National Program against AIDS, surveillance 
      in the Republic of Benin has relied on disease-control centers established in 20 
      selected locations. Seropositivity for HIV is always established by 
      Western-blotting and diagnosis of AIDS is based on BANGUI/WHO clinical criteria 
      and positive serologic tests. On June 30, 1993, the cumulative number of AIDS 
      cases reported to the WHO was 12/100000 inhabitants of Benin. The sex-ratio was 2 
      to 1 and 77.4% of cases occurred in the 20 to 49 year age range. Heterosexual 
      transmission accounted for 75.8% of cases and mother-to-child transmission for 
      6.4%. Overall the cumulative number of AIDS cases doubled each year from 1990 to 
      1992. The prevalence of HIV antibodies in target groups has been steady: less 
      than 1% of blood donors and urban or rural women undergoing prenatal 
      examinations. The prevalence of HIV antibodies has risen significantly every year 
      among patients with tuberculosis and people consulting for sexually transmitted 
      diseases. These findings corroborate the notion that the incidence of positive 
      serologic tests for HIV is low in Benin: less than 1% of the adult population.

AB  - The French Guyana is an Overseas French Department in South America, with 100,000 
      inhabitants among them are 20% of Haitian immigrants. At 31 December 1987, 103 
      AIDS cases have been recorded, 86% by heterosexual transmission. The first case 
      dated May 1979 was retroactively diagnosed in an Haitian parturient, thank to her 
      serum kept in the Pasteur institute of Cayenne. 44 women got their pregnancy 
      during their HIV infection: 5 with clinical and biological evidence of AIDS, 7 
      developed AIDS after getting pregnant, and 10 out of these 12 women died. All of 
      them were from a rather low social group and, generally, were not married. 43 are 
      black (40 Haitians and 3 Guyanese Creoles), one is Indian and presented some 
      psychic disorders. The mean age was 32 1/2 (from 15 to 51 years old). 55 babies 
      were born: 12 developed AIDS (6 died during the first 15 months of their life); 
      14 are HIV +, 3 stillborns, 4 never tested and 22 developed negative reaction 
      (with ELISA and Western-Blot) between 7.5 and 10 months of their life. Two 
      Hutchinson's triads were observed. Prurigo is the most commonly skin 
      manifestation observed.

PG  - 236-42
AB  - The "conventional" algorithm for HIV testing based on the confirmation of all 
      positive anti-HIV screening reactions by Western blot requires sufficient 
      laboratory facilities and is expensive, that limits its use in developing 
      countries, such as in subsaharian Africa. The apparition of second and third 
      generation screening ELISA which are very sensitive and specific, as well as the 
      development of rapid tests which are simple, visually read, and sufficiently 
      sensitive and specific, has permitted the design of "alternative" strategy for 
      HIV testing utilizing the association of 2 ELISA and/or rapid tests, in order to 
      limit the use of a confirmatory assay. Alternative strategies are less expensive, 
      yield generally very high sensitivity and specificity, and have proved to be 
      valuable for African countries. In this study, 5 alternative strategies, using 
      different associations of two second generation screening tests, one classical 
      ELISA (Genelavia mixt) and one rapid test (Test PACK HIV-1/HIV-2 AB) have been 
      retrospectively evaluated in the field in Bangui, Central African Republic, with 
      a panel of 130 sera (prevalence of HIV infection: 42.7%). The strategy using two 
      sequential screening tests (Test Pack HIV-1/HIV-2 AB following by Genelavia mixt) 
      with the confirmation of discordant results by Western blot permitted to diagnose 
      HIV-1 infection in Bangui with a sensitivity, a specificity and a positive 
      predictive value of 100%, and to reduce the cost of more than 50% in comparison 
      with the conventional strategy. Such an alternative strategy could be useful for 
      the individual notification of HIV serology in Bangui.

PG  - 319-22
AB  - Laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection is based on the detection of HIV 
      antibodies. There is a delay between infection and seroconversion (i.e. the 
      appearance of specific HIV antibodies) corresponding to a window period which may 
      last several weeks. Reduction of the length of the window period might be 
      achieved by using p24 antigen and/or viral nucleic acid detection assays. We have 
      evaluated a new screening assay (VIDAS HIV DUO) designed for the concurrent 
      detection of HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, using sequential samples of 34 HIV-1 
      seroconverting patients and 236 HIV-positive samples confirmed by Western blot. 
      Results were compared with those obtained with two third-generation anti-HIV 
      antibody screening assays. The 236 confirmed HIV-positive samples including 3 
      HIV-1 subtype O and 2 HIV-2 samples were found to be positive by the 3 assays. 
      All 128 sequential samples from 34 seroconverting patients were found to be 
      positive using the DUO assay, including 20/20 pre-seroconversion samples (p24 
      antigen-positive and anti-HIV negative). The new screening assay was positive 
      before a third-generation anti-HIV screening assay gave positive results in 14/34 
      patients (41%). Using the DUO assay, the mean reduction of the window period was 
      4 days.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the sero-prevalence of HIV 
      infections in pregnant women of the health area of Zamora, Spain by unlinked 
      anonymous screening and to estimate the percentage of non-diagnosed cases by 
      non-systematic screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Umbilical cord blood samples of 
      2,695 newborns at "Virgen de la Concha" hospital of Zamora collected between 
      January 1994 and December 1996 were stored with a code number and with no 
      personal identification. HIV antibody testing in the serum from the umbilical 
      cord blood was performed with an enzyme-immunoassay using pooled sera and 
      verified with Western blot. All children born to HIV-infected women during the 
      same period were registered. RESULTS: Four of 2,695 samples were seropositive. 
      HIV prevalence was 0.15% (CI 95%, 0.04-0.37). During the same period only 3 
      children born to HIV infected women were recognized. We estimate that at least 
      25% of seropositive women were undetected. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that routine 
      HIV screening should be offered to all pregnant women.

AB  - Sera from 124 persons in high risk groups were analyzed including homosexuals, 
      blood recipients, and spouses or siblings from AIDS patients. In this study, 118 
      individuals had a positive ELISA for anti-HIV antibodies. Six persons had a 
      complete immunodeficiency syndrome and a negative ELISA test. In the Western 
      blot, 111 sera were positive, four negative, and nine scored indeterminate; four 
      of the latter converted to positive when retested three months later. Antibodies 
      present in the positive sera were directed against the HIV gp 41 kD in 100% of 
      the cases and against the gp 120 kD in 82%. Frequency of recognition of p55 kD 
      was 96% but p18 kD was only 42%.

PG  - 111-5
AB  - The presence of antibodies against HIV-2 was analyzed in serum samples from 
      high-risk individuals for retrovirus infection, who were seropositives for HIV-1. 
      Out of a total of 842 samples, 344 presented positive absorbency and 16, 
      threshold ranges, in an enzymatic immunoassay (EIA) designed to detect 
      simultaneously antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2. The Western Blot (WB) analysis 
      confirmed the presence of antibodies against HIV-1 in 324 samples with positive 
      or threshold EIA, while it was indetermined in 15 samples. WB was negative in 11 
      samples. In the 15 samples with indetermined WB and in the 16 samples with 
      threshold EIA, the presence of antibodies against HIV-2 was investigated with an 
      specific WB and a test designed with synthetic peptides (Pepti-lav). Three 
      samples met the isolated seropositivity criteria for HIV-2. Those samples were 
      from 3 african immigrants living in Madrid, which, until now, were asymptomatic, 
      although one of them presented biological signs of immunodeficiency. None of them 
      referred high-risk infectious practices, such a homosexuality or drug-addiction, 
      although all of them referred heterosexual contacts in their native countries. 
      Samples from native subjects meeting serum positivity criteria for HIV-2 were not 
      identified.

PG  - 30-8
AB  - A team at the Colombian National Institute of Health (INS) has demonstrated the 
      usefulness and suitability of the Immunofluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) as a 
      confirmatory assay for HIV-1. The assay followed a flow chart method recommended 
      by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Federal Center for AIDS of 
      Canada. The specificity of the IFAT assay (IFI-VIH1-INS) for 925 serum samples 
      was 100% when compared with two different Western blot (WB) assays. The 
      IFI-VIH1-INS showed a sensitivity of 61% across 6,137 human sera. Although its 
      specificity is excellent, the sensitivity of the IFI-VIH1-INS assay is slightly 
      lower than other IFAT assays (41% of 975 samples were indeterminate in both IFAT 
      assays and WB tests). After implementation of this assay in more than 6,000 serum 
      samples between 1993 and 2000, the INS saved more than Col $340,000,000 or US 
      $170.000 in its HIV1 testing program.

AB  - From January 1997 to December 2000, 21145 blood donations have been collected and 
      tested for anti-HIV antibodies by the National Center of Blood Transfusion of 
      Conakry (NCBT). 347 were positive, confirmed by Western Blot (312 HIV-1, 20 HIV-2 
      and 15 HIV1-2). HIV seroprevalence in tested blood donations showed a slow 
      decrease by year: 1.87% in 1997 to 1.79% in 2000. The distribution according to 
      donation type was 1% for volunteer donors and 2% for family donors. 
      Seropositivity HIV rates according to sex indicate that the female donors are 
      more infected than male donors. Among 347 seropositive, 83% were more than 20 
      years old. The seroprevalence is higher in soldier blood donors 3.72% (53/1422) 
      than in student donors 0.55% (43/7712). The number of seropositive results found 
      during these 4 years is not really representative of the HIV spreading infection 
      in Guinean population, but their distribution according to sex and age is very 
      close to the distribution of the AIDS cases in Guinea.

AB  - To determine current seroprevalence of HIV in adult patients with pulmonary 
      tuberculosis in Yaounde, Cameroon, we prospectively studied 671 consecutive 
      patients aged 15 years or more, admitted to the chest clinic of Jamot Hospital 
      from July 1994 to December 1995. All sera were screened for HIV antibodies by 
      ELISA and positive sera were confirmed by western blotting. A total of 113 of the 
      671 patients (16.8%) were positive. There was no significant difference between 
      the overall rate of HIV seropositivity in men and women. However 20.5% of women 
      aged 15 to 24 years were HIV positive as compared to only 5.6% of men in the same 
      age group (p < 0.01). The seroprevalence rate was also significantly higher in 
      patients living in urban than rural areas (p < 0.02). There was no significant 
      difference between HIV seropositive and seronegative patients with respect to 
      marital status, level of education, or criminal record. Blood transfusion had 
      been performed in 9.7% of seropositive patients as compared to 4.5% of 
      seronegative patients (p = 0.02).

AB  - The presence of antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) 
      was retrospectively investigated in serum samples from 433 parenteral drug 
      abusers from Barcelona. A third generation ELISA was used for the initial 
      screening of sera, and a specific western blot technique for the definitive 
      confirmation of the results. The presence of anti-HIV-2 was demonstrated in 9 
      samples (prevalence 2.1%). All of them belonged to patients also infected with 
      HIV-1. The 9 cases reported here are the first seropositive patients for HIV-2 
      described in native individuals from this country.

AB  - Our main objective has been geared toward the appreciation of the importance of 
      the infection by human immunodeficiency virus in Mali. Our study was based on 
      3,496 sera deducted from March 1987 to January 1989. All positive sera at ELISA 
      have been confirmed by Western Blot. The total seroprevalence of the study is 
      8.41%. This fact has been noticed higher in prostitutes, young men, more in women 
      than in men in widows and divorced couples, in traders, in travellers of high 
      endemic countries. The seropositivity is proportional to the number of sexual 
      partners. The heterosexual way of transmission has been dominant. There has been 
      no relationship between seropositivity and transfusion, antecedent of surgery, 
      sexually transmitted diseases, of sexual intercourse type. The HIV2 has been more 
      frequent than HIV1. Taking into account the importance of this infection, 
      precautionary measures must be taken to avoid an evolution toward a catastrophic 
      situation.

PG  - 223-7
AB  - We have studied 70 children, born to HIV seropositive mothers, since the first 
      trimester of life and every three months thereafter. The virological markers we 
      used in the diagnosis included: 1) p24 antigen detection. 2) Autochthonous 
      production of antibodies detected by Western Blot technique. 3) HIV isolation. 4) 
      Specific determination of IgM antibodies. In infected children under 15 months of 
      age, p24 antigen was positive in 78%, HIV was isolated in 75% and autochthonous 
      production of antibodies occurred in 50%. IgM specific antibodies were detected 
      in 92%, but these were also detected in the 33% of the children who seroreverted. 
      In seroreverted children, the other three virological markers were negative. The 
      problems due to the low sensitivity in p24 antigen detection, HIV isolation and 
      the detection of autochthonous production of antibodies, as well as the low 
      specificity of the IgM detection, means that it is necessary to simultaneously 
      use several techniques in the diagnosis of these children.

AB  - A seroepidemiological study of endemic treponematosis (bejel) in Niger allows us 
      to realise an anonymous non correlated screening of VIH infection in Nomads: 
      Touaregs of Tchirozerine (Agadez), Peuls Boro of Bermo (Maradi). On the 424 
      Touaregs screened only one was seropositive to VIH2 infection confirmed with 
      Western blot that means 0.23% of seroprevalency comparable to that 0.50% found in 
      the general population. The seroprevalency of trepronematosis (VDRL + TPHA+) is 
      7% in the range of 5 to 15 years old (80%), period which corresponds to the 
      transmission of Bejel. Moreover this population don't travel to the seaborder 
      countries. Concerning the 213 of the Peuls Bororo screened we had only 3 
      undetermined reactions to Western blot 1 and 2, despite the high seroprevalence 
      of the treponematosis (VDRL+ TPHA+): 22% mostly in the subjects of more than 15 
      years old (89.36%) which is the sexual intercourse and exodus period to the 
      seaborder countries, where 66% of our VIH patients are infected.

      HIV-1 antibodies. However, some patients remain with an indeterminate diagnosis 
      for HIV-1 according to the technique. We followed 8 such patients for 2 to 18 
      months. Immunologic studies included standard ELISA, immunofluorescence and 
      Abbott anti-p24 ELISA. We found selective reactivity for certain viral proteins 
      such as isolated p24, p24 plus p51 or p55, gp41 plus gp 120, p17 plus p24 and 
      p25.

AB  - The results of a serum inquiry for detection of antibodies against the Human 
      Immuno-deficiency Virus in a non selected group of children, patients of a 
      general pediatric ward, are reported. Of the 441 cases, the ELISA test gave a 
      positive result for 1.1% of them. This result was confirmed by the Western-Blot 
      or ImmunoBlot test. None of the five children who tested positive had a previous 
      history of blood transfusion. These children's mothers showed positive results to 
      the ELISA test. Of four cases, at least one of the parents was IV drug addicted. 
      In every case the transmission was vertical. On the basis of these findings, it 
      is suggested that hospital staff should take the necessary precautions when 
      manipulating blood and secretions and it is recommended that serum inquiries be 
      made on the wards of general hospitals in the attempt to establish reliable data 
      on the prevalence of HIV.

      study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity in that country].
PG  - 397-9
AB  - Since late 1985, the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar has studied the problem of 
      the distribution of HIV in the island. With the approval and cooperation of the 
      Malagasy Ministry of Health, a number of different surveys have been undertaken, 
      particularly of those sections of the population diagnosed as being of 
      "high-risk". In 1987, a Malagasy prostitute from the country's second largest 
      port was identified as seropositive. One case of clinical AIDS was diagnosed in 
      1988 in a Franco-Malagasy subject living in NOSY BE. Systematic tests for 
      seropositivity among women with multiple partners in nine "high-risk" areas of 
      the country are applied. The aim of this survey during 1988 is to make such 
      groups aware of the vital necessity of overcoming the problem by preventing its 
      growth by taking appropriate measures. The IPM has obtained government approval 
      and has established the facilities to confirm findings of seropositivity among 
      the population of Madagascar.

AB  - We report three patients who developed a generalized rash with oral, genital or 
      perianal ulcerations as a result of acute infection due to HIV. The primary 
      infection was diagnosed by seroconversion (by means of EIA and Western blot 
      techniques). Definitive diagnosis was established on days 52, 85 and 97 after the 
      appearance of the rash. The p24 protein of the HIV was only detected in the early 
      phase of the disorder in the two cases in which this study was carried out.
