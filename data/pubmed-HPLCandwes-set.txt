AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is currently one 
      of the most prominent and global chronic conditions. Huanglian Decoction (HLD) is 
      a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation that has been used to treat T2DM 
      for thousands of years in China. However, its mechanism of action at the 
      metabolic level is still unclear. The purpose of this work is to study the 
      mechanism of HLD in treating T2DM based on metabolomics and network pharmacology. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, metabolomics combined with network 
      pharmacology was used to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of HLD in T2DM. 
      Serum samples were collected from rats with T2DM, induced by a high-sugar and 
      high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ), to measure the levels of 
      biochemical markers. Urinary metabolomics-based analysis using high-performance 
      liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was conducted to 
      evaluate the differential metabolites from multiple metabolic pathways. RESULTS: 
      After treatment with HLD for 4 weeks, biochemical indicators, including fasting 
      blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid, fasting insulin (FINS), insulin sensitivity 
      index (ISI), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 
      were significantly improved. Metabolomics results revealed that HLD regulated the 
      biomarkers, such as cytosine, L-carnitine, betaine, phenylalanine, glucose, 
      citrate, phenylpyruvate, and hippuric acid in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate 
      metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The 
      combination of network pharmacology, metabolomics, western blot, and PCR showed 
      that HLD can treat T2DM by enhancing the gene and protein expression levels of 
      glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor (INSR), and mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) to interfere with glyoxylate and dicarboxylate 
      metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The study based on metabolomics and network pharmacology 
      indicated that HLD can improve T2DM through multiple targets and pathways, and it 
      may be a useful alternative therapy for the treatment of T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot (DF) is one of the serious complications of diabetes 
      and lacks of therapeutic drugs. Abnormal and chronic inflammation promoting foot 
      infection and wound healing delay are the main pathogenesis of DF. The 
      traditional prescription San Huang Xiao Yan Recipe (SHXY) has been used in the 
      clinical treatment of DF for several decades as approved hospital experience 
      prescription and showed remarkable therapeutic effect, but the mechanisms by 
      which SHXY treats DF are still unclear. PURPOSE: Objectives of this study were to 
      investigate SHXY anti-inflammatory effect on DF and explore the molecular 
      mechanism for SHXY. METHODS: We detected the effects of SHXY on DF in C57 mouse 
      and SD rat DF models. Animal blood glucose, weight and wound area were detected 
      every week. Serum inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA. H&E and Masson's 
      trichrome were used to observe tissue pathology. Single-cell sequencing data 
      reanalysis revealed the role of M1 macrophages in DF. Venn analysis showed the 
      co-target genes between DF M1 macrophages and compound-disease network 
      pharmacology. Western blotting was used to explored target protein expression. 
      Meanwhile, RAW264.7 cells were treated with drug-containing serum of SHXY to 
      further unravel the roles of target proteins during high glucose-induced 
      inflammation in vitro. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 was used on RAW 264.7 cells to 
      further explore the relationship between Nrf2, AMPK and HMGB1. The main 
      components of SHXY were analysed by HPLC. Finally, the treatment effect of SHXY 
      on DF were detected on rat DF model. RESULTS: In vivo, SHXY can ameliorate 
      inflammatory, accelerate wound healing and upregulate expression of Nrf2, AMPK 
      and downregulate of HMGB1. Bioinformatic analysis showed that M1 macrophages were 
      the main inflammatory cell population in DF. Moreover, the Nrf2 downstream 
      proteins HO-1 and HMGB1 were potential DF therapeutic targets for SHXY. In vitro, 
      we also found that SHXY increased AMPK and Nrf2 protein levels and downregulated 
      HMGB1 expression in RAW264.7 cells. Inhibiting the expression of Nrf2 impaired 
      the inhibition effect of SHXY on HMGB1. SHXY promoted Nrf2 translocation into the 
      nucleus and increased the phosphorylation of Nrf2. SHXY also inhibited HMGB1 
      extracelluar release under high glucose. In rat DF models, SHXY also exhibited 
      significant anti-inflammatory effect. CONCLUSION: The SHXY activated AMPK/Nrf2 
      pathway to suppress abnormal inflammation on DF via inhibiting HMGB1 expression. 
      These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which SHXY treats DF.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Simiao San (SmS), a famous traditional Chinese 
      formula, is clinically used to treat patients with hyperuricemia (HUA). However, 
      its mechanism of action on lowering uric acid (UA) and inhibiting inflammation 
      still deserves further investigation. AIM OF THE STUDY: To examine the effect and 
      its possible underlying mechanism of SmS on UA metabolism and kidney injury in 
      HUA mouse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HUA mouse model was constructed with the 
      combined administration of both potassium oxalate and hypoxanthine. The effects 
      of SmS on UA, xanthine oxidase (XOD), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen 
      (BUN), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and 
      tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined by ELISA or biochemical assays. 
      Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) was used to observe pathological alterations in the 
      kidneys of HUA mice. The expression levels of organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), 
      recombinant urate transporter 1 (URAT1), glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), 
      nucleotide binding domain and leucine rich repeat pyrin domain containing 3 
      (NLRP3), Cleaved-Caspase 1, apoptosis-associated speck like protein (ASC), 
      nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), IL-6, janus kinase 2 (JAK2), phosphor (P)-JAK2, 
      signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), P-STAT3, suppressor 
      of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) were examined by Western blot and/or 
      immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The major ingredients in SmS were identified 
      by a HPLC-MS assay. RESULTS: HUA mouse exhibited an elevation in serum levels of 
      UA, BUN, CRE, XOD, and the ratio of urinary albumin to creatinine (UACR), and a 
      decline in urine levels of UA and CRE. In addition, HUA induces pro-inflammatory 
      microenvironment in mouse, including an increase in serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, 
      and TNF-α, and renal expressions of URAT1, GULT9, NLRP3, ASC, Cleaved-Caspase1, 
      P-JAK2/JAK2, P-STAT3/STAT3, and SOCS3, and a decrease in serum IL-10 level and 
      renal OAT1 expression as well as a disorganization of kidney pathological 
      microstructure. In contrast, SmS intervention reversed these alterations in HUA 
      mouse. CONCLUSION: SmS could alleviate hyperuricemia and renal inflammation in 
      HUA mouse. The action mechanisms behind these alterations may be associated with 
      a limitation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways.

AB  - Introduction: Ji-Ni-De-Xie (JNDX) is a traditional herbal preparation in China. 
      It is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in traditional Tibetan 
      medicine system. However, its antidiabetic mechanisms have not been elucidated. 
      The aim of this study is to elucidate the underlying mechanism of JNDX on bile 
      acids (BAs) metabolism and FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway in T2DM rats. Methods: 
      High-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-QQQ-MS) and UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS technology were used to identify 
      the constituents in JNDX. High-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (45 
      mg∙kg(-1)) (STZ) was used to establish a T2DM rat model, and the levels of 
      fasting blood-glucose (FBG), glycosylated serum protein (GSP), homeostasis model 
      assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), LPS, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, TG, TC, 
      LDL-C, HDL-C, and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were measured to evaluate the 
      anti-diabetic activity of JNDX. In addition, metagenomic analysis was performed 
      to detect changes in gut microbiota. The metabolic profile of BAs was analyzed by 
      HPLC-QQQ-MS. Moreover, the protein and mRNA expressions of FXR and FGF15 in the 
      colon and the protein expressions of FGF15 and CYP7A1 in the liver of T2DM rats 
      were measured by western blot and RT-qPCR. Results: A total of 12 constituents 
      were identified by HPLC-QQQ-MS in JNDX. Furthermore, 45 chemical components in 
      serum were identified from JNDX via UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS technology, 
      including 22 prototype components and 23 metabolites. Using a T2DM rat model, we 
      found that JNDX (0.083, 0.165 and 0.33 g/kg) reduced the levels of FBG, GSP, 
      HOMA-IR, LPS, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, TG, TC, and LDL-C, and increased ISI and HDL-C 
      levels in T2DM rats. Metagenomic results demonstrated that JNDX treatment 
      effectively improved gut microbiota dysbiosis, including altering some bacteria 
      (e.g., Streptococcus and Bacteroides) associated with BAs metabolism. 
      Additionally, JNDX improved BAs disorder in T2DM rats, especially significantly 
      increasing cholic acid (CA) levels and decreasing ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 
      levels. Moreover, the protein and mRNA expressions of FXR and FGF15 of T2DM rats 
      were significantly increased, while the expression of CYP7A1 protein in the liver 
      was markedly inhibited by JNDX. Discussion: JNDX can effectively improve insulin 
      resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation in T2DM rats. The 
      mechanism is related to its regulation of BAs metabolism and activation of 
      FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway.

AB  - There are approximately 250 species of Eryngium L. distributed throughout the 
      world, with North America and South America being centers of diversity on this 
      continent. In the central-western region of Mexico there may be around 28 species 
      of this genus. Some Eryngium species are cultivated as leafy vegetables, 
      ornamental, and medicinal plants. In traditional medicine they are used to treat 
      respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, among 
      others. This review addresses the phytochemistry and biological activities, as 
      well as traditional uses, distribution, and characteristics of the eight species 
      of Eryngium reported as medicinal in the central-western region of Mexico: E. 
      cymosum, E. longifolium, E. fluitans (or mexicanum), E. beecheyanum, E. carlinae, 
      E. comosum, E. heterophyllum, and E. nasturtiifolium. The extracts of the 
      different Eryngium spp. have shown biological activities such as hypoglycemic, 
      hypocholesterolemic, renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and 
      antioxidant, among others. E. carlinae is the most studied species, and 
      phytochemical analyses, performed mainly by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry 
      (GC-MS), have shown its content of terpenoids, fatty acids, organic acids, 
      phenolic acids, flavonoids, sterols, saccharides, polyalcohols, and aromatic and 
      aliphatic aldehydes. According to the results of this review on Eryngium spp., 
      they constitute a relevant alternative as a source of bioactive compounds for 
      pharmaceutical, food, and other industries. However, there is a lot of research 
      to be conducted regarding phytochemistry, biological activities, cultivation, and 
      propagation, in those species with few or no reports.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We previously demonstrated that diabetes exacerbates stroke-induced 
      brain injury, and that this correlates with brain methylglyoxal 
      (MG)-to-glutathione (GSH) status. Cerebral injury was reversed by 
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Here we tested if the pro-thrombotic phenotype seen in 
      the systemic circulation and brain during diabetes was associated with increased 
      MG-glycation of proteins, and if NAC could reverse this. METHODS: The 
      streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes was used. Thrombus 
      formation in venules and arterioles (pial circulation) was determined by 
      intravital videomicroscopy using the light-dye method. Circulating blood 
      platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) were analyzed by flow cytometry 1 wk before 
      other measurements. GSH and MG levels in platelets were measured by HPLC. 
      MG-modified proteins, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), and superoxide 
      dismutase-1 (SOD1) levels were detected in platelets by western blot at 20 weeks. 
      Proteins involved in coagulation were quantified by ELISA. NAC (2mM) was given in 
      drinking water for 3 weeks before the terminal experiment. RESULTS: Thrombus 
      development was accelerated by diabetes in a time-dependent manner. % PLAs were 
      significantly elevated by diabetes. Plasma activated plasminogen activator 
      inhibitor type 1 levels were progressively increased with diabetes duration, with 
      tail bleeding time reduced by 20 wks diabetes. Diabetes lowered platelet GSH 
      levels, GPx-1 and SOD-1 expression. This was associated with higher MG levels, 
      and increased MG-adduct formation in platelets. NAC treatment partly or 
      completely reversed the effects of diabetes. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these 
      results show that the diabetic blood and brain become progressively more 
      susceptible to platelet activation and thrombosis. NAC, given after the 
      establishment of diabetes, may offer protection against the risk for stroke by 
      altering both systemic and vascular prothrombotic responses via enhancing 
      platelet GSH, and GSH-dependent MG elimination, as well as correcting levels of 
      antioxidants such as SOD1 and GPx-1.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Clerodendranthus spicatus is a traditional 
      Chinese medicine and has been used to treat diabetes and some kidney diseases for 
      a long history. AIM OF THE STUDY: The research aimed to study the active 
      constituents, the potential targets and the related mechanisms of C. spicatus in 
      the treatment of diabetes through network pharmacology method and verify the 
      antidiabetic activity by molecular biology experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      comprehensive network pharmacology strategy was used to predict the key active 
      constituents, the key targets and the related mechanisms and pathways of C. 
      spicatus in the treatment of diabetes. The strategy mainly included screening and 
      predicting potential active constituents and targets by network construction, GO 
      (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment 
      analysis. Based on the predicted results, C. spicatus was extracted by ultrasonic 
      method with 50% ethanol and enriched by using macroporous resin. The compounds 
      with potential antidiabetic effects were separated through silica-gel column 
      chromatography and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography), and then 
      identified by MS (mass spectrum) and NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). The C. 
      spicatus extract and isolated compounds were tested by in-vitro and cell 
      experiments to verify their antidiabetic activities, including antioxidant 
      activities, inhibition activities on α-glucosidase and α-amylase, the influence 
      on glucose uptake in cell experiments and the Western blot of PI3K and Akt 
      expression levels. RESULTS: A total of 18 active constituents and 16 key targets 
      of C. spicatus in the treatment of diabetes were screened out through network 
      pharmacology method. Phenolic acids might be the main target compounds for the 
      next research. After extraction, enrichment and separation, the phenolic 
      acids-enriched fraction of C. spicatus and four phenolic acid compounds 
      (helisterculin C, salvianolic acid B, orthosiphoic acid E and ethyl caffeate) 
      were obtained. Among them, salvianolic acid B was isolated from C. spicatus for 
      the first time and orthosiphoic acid E was isolated from natural products for the 
      first time. In experiment verification, the crude extract of C. spicatus, the 
      phenolic acids-enriched fraction and the four compounds all showed antidiabetic 
      potentials. The phenolic acids in C. spicatus had antioxidant activities, 
      inhibitory activities on α-amylase and α-glucosidase and promoted glucose uptake 
      in L6 cells through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed 
      that C. spicatus had antidiabetic activities with the mechanism of the mode of 
      multi-compounds acting on multi-targets and multi-pathways. The main active 
      phenolic acid compounds were also identified. It provided theoretical basis for 
      further development and utilization of C. spicatus.

TI  - Calcium Dobesilate Prevents Neurodegeneration and Vascular Leakage in 
      Experimental Diabetes.
PG  - 1273-1286

AB  - PURPOSE: The mechanisms involved in the reported beneficial effects of Calcium 
      dobesilate monohydrate (CaD) for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) 
      remain to be elucidated. The main aim of the present study is to examine whether 
      CaD prevents early events in the pathogenesis of DR such as neurodegeneration and 
      vascular leakage. In addition, putative mediators of both neurodegeneration 
      (glutamate/GLAST, ET-1/ETB receptor) and early microvascular impairment (ET-1/ETA 
      receptor, oxidative stress, VEGF, and the PKC-delta-p38 MAPK pathway) have been 
      examined. METHODS: Diabetic (db/db) mice were randomly assigned to daily oral 
      treatment with CaD (200 mg/Kg/day) (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 12) for 14 days. In 
      addition, 12 non-diabetic (db/+) mice matched by age were used as the control 
      group. Functional abnormalities were assessed by electroretinography. 
      Neurodegeneration and microvascular abnormalities were evaluated by 
      immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Glutamate was determined by HPLC. RESULTS: 
      CaD significantly decreased glial activation and apoptosis and produced a 
      significant improvement in the electroretinogram parameters. Mechanistically, CaD 
      prevented the diabetes-induced up-regulation of ET-1 and its cognate receptors 
      (ETA-R and ETB-R), which are involved in microvascular impairment and 
      neurodegeneration, respectively. In addition, treatment with CaD downregulated 
      GLAST, the main glutamate transporter, and accordingly prevented the increase in 
      glutamate. Finally, CaD prevented oxidative stress, and the upregulation of VEGF 
      and PKC delta-p38 MAPK pathway induced by diabetes, thus resulting in a 
      significant reduction in vascular leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate 
      for the first time that CaD exerts neuroprotection in an experimental model of 
      DR. In addition, we provide first evidence that CaD prevents the overexpression 
      of ET-1 and its receptors in the diabetic retina. These beneficial effects on the 
      neurovascular unit could pave the way for clinical trials addressed to confirm 
      the effectiveness of CaD in very early stages of DR.

TI  - Pre-diabetes alters testicular PGC1-α/SIRT3 axis modulating mitochondrial 
      bioenergetics and oxidative stress.

AB  - Pre-diabetes, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes development, leads to metabolic 
      changes at testicular level. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ 
      coactivator 1 α (PGC-1α) and Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) are pivotal in mitochondrial 
      function. We hypothesized that pre-diabetes disrupts testicular PGC-1α/Sirt3 
      axis, compromising testicular mitochondrial function. Using a high-energy-diet 
      induced pre-diabetic rat model, we evaluated testicular levels of PGC-1α and its 
      downstream targets, nuclear respiratory factors 1 (NRF-1) and 2 (NRF-2), 
      mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and Sirt3. We also assessed 
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, mitochondrial function, energy levels and 
      oxidative stress parameters. Protein levels were quantified by Western Blot, 
      mtDNA content was determined by qPCR. Mitochondrial complex activity and 
      oxidative stress parameters were spectrophotometrically evaluated. Adenine 
      nucleotide levels, adenosine and its metabolites (inosine and hypoxanthine) were 
      determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Pre-diabetic rats showed increased blood 
      glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance. Both testicular PGC-1α and Sirt3 
      levels were decreased. NRF-1, NRF-2 and TFAM were not altered. Testicular mtDNA 
      content was decreased. Mitochondrial complex I activity was increased, whereas 
      mitochondrial complex III activity was decreased. Adenylate energy charge was 
      decreased in pre-diabetic rats, as were ATP and ADP levels. Conversely, AMP 
      levels were increased, evidencing a decreased ATP/AMP ratio. Concerning to 
      oxidative stress pre-diabetes decreased testicular antioxidant capacity and 
      increased lipid and protein oxidation. In sum, pre-diabetes compromises 
      testicular mitochondrial function by repressing PGC-1α/Sirt3 axis and mtDNA copy 
      number, declining respiratory capacity and increasing oxidative stress. This 
      study gives new insights into overall testicular bioenergetics at this prodromal 
      stage of disease.

TI  - Activation of Macrophages and Microglia by Interferon-γ and Lipopolysaccharide 
      Increases Methylglyoxal Production: A New Mechanism in the Development of 
      Vascular Complications and Cognitive Decline in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus?
PG  - 467-479
LID - 10.3233/JAD-161152 [doi]
AB  - Methylglyoxal (MGO), a dicarbonyl compound derived from glucose, is elevated in 
      diabetes mellitus and contributes to vascular complications by crosslinking 
      collagen and increasing arterial stiffness. It is known that MGO contributes to 
      inflammation as it forms advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which activate 
      macrophages via the receptor RAGE. The aim of study was to investigate whether 
      inflammatory activation can increase MGO levels, thereby completing a vicious 
      cycle. In order to validate this, macrophage (RAW264.7, J774A.1) and microglial 
      (N11) cells were stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS (5 + 5 and 10 + 10 IFN-γ U/ml or 
      μg/ml LPS), and extracellular MGO concentration was determined after 
      derivatization with 5,6-Diamino-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine sulfate by HPLC. MGO 
      levels in activated macrophage cells (RAW264.7) peaked at 48 h, increasing 
      2.86-fold (3.14±0.4 μM) at 5 U/ml IFN-γ+5 μg/ml LPS, and 4.74-fold (5.46±0.30 μM) 
      at 10 U/ml IFN-γ+10 μg/ml LPS compared to the non-activated controls (1.15±0.02 
      μM). The other two cell lines, J774A.1 macrophages and N11 microglia, showed a 
      similar response. We suggest that inflammation increases MGO production, possibly 
      exacerbating arterial stiffness, cardiovascular complications, and 
      diabetes-related cognitive decline.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gliclazide in Caucasians and Australian 
      Aborigines with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - AIMS: Gliclazide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed in 9 
      Caucasians and 10 Australian Aborigines with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes. 
      METHODS: Subjects were on a stable dose of 80 mg gliclazide twice daily, took 160 
      mg on the morning of study and had a standard breakfast. No further gliclazide 
      was given over the next 48 h. Regular blood samples were drawn for serum glucose, 
      insulin and gliclazide assay. Gliclazide was measured using h.p.l.c. 
      Noncompartmental analysis was used to describe primary data. A multicompartment 
      model incorporating entero-hepatic recirculation was fitted to group mean serum 
      gliclazide profiles. RESULTS: The Caucasians were older than the Aborigines (mean 
      +/- s.d. age 53.4 +/- 12.2 vs 40.3 +/- 6.9 years, P < 0.05) but had similar 
      diabetes duration, body mass index and glycated haemoglobin. Noncompartmental 
      analysis revealed no between-group differences in gliclazide kinetics. 
      Post-breakfast serum glucose and insulin responses were also similar apart from a 
      longer time to maximum concentration (tmax) for glucose amongst the Aborigines 
      (2.6 +/- 0.4 vs 2.2 +/- 0. 3 h in Caucasians; P = 0.024). Gliclazide tmax 
      exhibited a skewed unimodal distribution and was not associated with gliclazide 
      maximum concentration, or glucose or insulin responses. Most patients had a serum 
      gliclazide profile suggestive of enterohepatic recirculation and/or biphasic 
      absorption. Model-derived estimates of the extent of putative enterohepatic 
      recirculation were 30% and 20% of dose in Caucasians and Aborigines, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Gliclazide is equally effective in Caucasian and 
      Aboriginal diabetic patients. The pharmacokinetics of oral gliclazide appear more 
      complex than previously thought. Gliclazide pharmacodynamics are unrelated to 
      rate and extent of absorption, consistent with a threshold concentration for 
      hypoglycaemic effect.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: SiJunZi decoction (SJZD), one of the traditional 
      Chinese medicine formulas, has been clinically and traditionally used to improve 
      glucose and lipid metabolism and promote bone remodeling. AIM OF THE STUDY: To 
      study the actions and mechanisms of SJZD on bone remodeling in a type 2 diabetes 
      mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetic mice generated with a high-fat diet 
      (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) were subjected to SJZD treatment for 8 weeks. 
      Blood glucose and lipid profile, redox status and bone metabolism were determined 
      by ELISA or biochemical assays. Bone quality was evaluated by micro-CT, 
      three-point bending assay and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR). Bone 
      histomorphometry alterations were evaluated by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E), tartrate 
      resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and Safranin O-fast green staining. 
      The expressions of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), advanced glycation end products 
      (AGEs), receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE), phosphorylated 
      nuclear factor kappa-B (p-NF-κB), NF-κB, cathepsin K, semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), 
      insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), p-GSK-3β, (p)-β-catenin, Runt-related 
      transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Cyclin D1 in the femurs and/or tibias were 
      examined by Western blot or immunohistochemical staining. The main constituents 
      in the SJZD aqueous extract were characterized by a HPLC/MS. RESULTS: SJZD 
      intervention improved glucose and lipid metabolism and preserved bone quality in 
      the diabetic mice, in particular glucose tolerance, lipid profile, bone 
      microarchitecture, strength and material composition. SJZD administration to 
      diabetic mice preserved redox homeostasis in serum and bone marrow, and prevented 
      an increase in AGEs, RAGE, p-NF-κB/NF-κB, cathepsin K, p-GSK-3β, p-β-catenin 
      expressions and a decrease in Sema3A, IGF1, β-catenin, Runx2 and Cyclin D1 
      expressions in tibias and/or femurs. Thirteen compounds were identified in SJZD 
      aqueous extract, including astilbin, liquiritin apioside, ononin, ginsenoside Re, 
      Rg1, Rb1, Rb2, Ro, Rb3, Rd, notoginsenoside R2, glycyrrhizic acid, and 
      licoricesaponin B2. CONCLUSIONS: SJZD ameliorates bone quality in diabetic mice 
      possibly via maintaining redox homeostasis. The mechanism governing these 
      alterations are possibly related to effects on the AGEs/RAGE and Wnt/β-catenin 
      signaling pathways. SJZD may offer a novel source of drug candidates for the 
      prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is 
      characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins. 
      Evidence indicates that AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) share 
      pathophysiological characteristics, including impaired insulin sensitivity. 
      Large-leaf yellow tea (LYT) has been widely recognized for its health benefits, 
      and we previously found that LYT can improve peripheral insulin resistance. 
      PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying 
      mechanisms of LYT in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. METHODS: HPLC and 
      spectrophotometric methods determined the chemical composition of the LYT 
      extract. 5xFAD mice were treated with LYT supplementation (2 and 4 mg/ml) in 
      drinking water for six months. Barnes and Y mazes were used to evaluate cognitive 
      function, and the open field test assessed anxiety-like behavior. 
      Immunofluorescence, silver, and Nissl staining were used to evaluate the 
      pathological effects of LYT extract. A FRET-based assay assessed β-site APP 
      cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity, ELISA measured Aβ levels in the brain, and 
      Western blot analyses explored protein expression levels. RESULTS: Our results 
      revealed that LYT significantly attenuated memory impairment and anxiety levels 
      and alleviated cerebral neural damage. A reduction of senile plaques was also 
      observed in both the cortex and hippocampus. LYT significantly inhibited the 
      activity of BACE1, which resulted in a lower Aβ protein level. In addition, LYT 
      enhanced insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-mediated phosphorylation of 
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT), further 
      suppressed glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), and ultimately inhibited 
      hyperphosphorylation of the protein Tau. The inhibitory effect of the LYT extract 
      on the phosphorylation of Tau and BACE1 activity was dose-dependent. CONCLUSION: 
      LYT improves cognitive ability and reduces Aβ production by inhibiting BACE1 
      activity. Decreases of Tau protein hyperphosphorylation upon LYT treatment appear 
      to be associated with the regulation of the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β axis. Thus, the 
      findings of this study also provide new evidence that LYT regulates insulin 
      signaling pathways within the central nervous system.

TI  - Gegen Qinlian Decoction ameliorates type 2 diabetes osteoporosis via 
      IGFBP3/MAPK/NFATc1 signaling pathway based on cytokine antibody array.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis affects more than half the patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM). Up to data, there is no effective clinical practice in managing 
      type 2 diabetes osteoporosis (T2DOP) because of its complex pathogenesis. Gegen 
      Qinlian Decoction (GQD) has been used for the long-term management of T2DM. 
      However, the underlying mechanism of GQD in the treatment of T2DOP remains 
      unknown. PURPOSE: To reveal the role of GQD in T2DOP and its potential 
      therapeutic targets in the management of T2DOP. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of GQD 
      on T2DOP was observed in db/db mice in four groups: model group, GQD low-dose 
      group (GQD-L), GQD high-dose group (GQD-H), and metformin (positive control) 
      group. C57BL/6J mice were used as the negative control group. METHODS: 
      Quantitative phytochemical analysis of GQD was performed using high-performance 
      liquid chromatography (HPLC). Micro-CT and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining were 
      used to evaluate bone histomorphometry. To screen for candidate targets of GQD, a 
      cytokine antibody array was used, followed by bioinformatics analysis. 
      Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) were used to 
      determine expression levels. RESULTS: The major active components of GQD were 
      confirmed by HPLC. Micro-CT and H&E staining showed that bone mass was 
      significantly increased in the GQD-H group compared with the model group. 
      Antibody arrays revealed that the expression of insulin-like growth factor 
      binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) was elevated in the GQD-H group. The MAPK pathway was 
      identified using bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, the levels of 
      osteoclastogenesis-related genes, including cathepsin K (Ctsk), acid phosphatase 
      5 (Acp5), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9), and ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit 
      D2 (Atp6v0d2) were significantly decreased in the GQD-H group. Compared with the 
      model group, high-dosage GQD inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
      and the expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1). 
      CONCLUSION: GQD plays a protective role in T2DOP by upregulating IGFBP3 
      expression and downregulating the IGFBP3/MAPK/NFATc1 signaling pathway. IGFBP3 in 
      serum may also be a novel biomarker in the treatment of T2DOP. Our current 
      findings not only expand the application of GQD, but also provide a theoretical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the progression of 
      diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Damaged mitochondria produce excessive reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) that can cause apoptosis. Mitochondrial dynamics control the 
      quality and function of mitochondria. Targeting mitochondrial dynamics may reduce 
      ROS-induced apoptosis and improve renal injury in DKD. Modified Hu-lu-ba-wan 
      (MHLBW) shows distinct clinical effects on DKD patients, which are related to its 
      role in antioxidant stress modulation. However, the relevant mechanisms of MHLBW 
      have not been clearly explored. PURPOSE: This study was aimed to evaluate the 
      therapeutic effects of MHLBW on spontaneous DKD mice and clarify the potential 
      mechanisms. METHODS: The main components of MHLBW were identified by HPLC. Using 
      db/db mice as DKD models, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of MHLBW on mice 
      after an 8-week administration. We investigated the molecular mechanism of MHLBW 
      in regulating mitochondrial dynamic homeostasis, podocyte apoptosis, and 
      glomerular damage. After that, computational docking analysis and in vitro 
      experiments were conducted for further mechanism verification. RESULTS: 
      Intragastric administration of MHLBW for 8 weeks in db/db mice significantly 
      improved glucose metabolism, basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, 
      glomerular fibrosis, and podocyte injury. MHLBW can reverse podocyte apoptosis 
      via promoting mitochondrial dynamic homeostasis, which was related to regulating 
      the PKM2/ PGC-1α/Opa1 pathway. Berberine (BBR), one of the components of MHLBW, 
      exhibited preeminent affinity with PKM2 as reflected by computational docking 
      analysis. In cultured podocytes, BBR can also prevent apoptosis by promoting 
      PKM2-mediated mitochondrial dynamic homeostasis. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      demonstrates that MHLBW can treat DKD by inhibiting glomerular damage and 
      podocyte apoptosis through positive regulation of PKM2-mediated mitochondrial 
      dynamic homeostasis. These results may provide a potential strategy against DKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have 
      dramatically increased. The intestinal flora and its derived metabolites are 
      demonstrated to play vital roles in the etiology and onset of T2DM. 
      Shouhuitongbian (SHTB) is a traditional Chinese formula to treat constipation. 
      SHTB is composed of seven herbs and components of Colla corii asini (CCA) that 
      are obtained from the hide of Equus asinus L.. Some of herbs in SHTB such as Aloe 
      vera (L.) Burm.f., Cassia obtusifolia L., fruits of Lycium barbarum L., and 
      Citrus aurantium L. have shown to improve insulin resistance (IR) and T2DM in 
      early reports. We hypothesized that SHTB composed of these herbs has antidiabetic 
      effects. The antidiabetic efficacy and mechanism of action of SHTB have not been 
      previously reported. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To demonstrate the antidiabetic effect 
      and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of SHTB from the perspective of gut 
      microbiota. STUDY DESIGN: The main compounds were identified and quantified by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectrometry analysis. High 
      fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and db/db mice were used to assess the antidiabetic 
      effects and the mechanism of SHTB. The underlying mechanisms were evaluated by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot analysis, quantitative 
      real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, 16S rRNA high-throughput 
      sequencing, and targeted metabolome analysis. METHODS: HFD-fed mice and db/db 
      mice were orally treated with the standard positive drug metformin (100 mg/kg/d) 
      and with SHTB (200 and 100 mg/kg/d), which was chemically characterized according 
      to the European Medicine Agency (EMA) guidelines. The beneficial effects of SHTB 
      were studied by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 
      index, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), total 
      cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), and inflammation. Subsequently, 16S 
      rDNA-based high-throughput pyrosequencing and GC-MS-based targeted metabolomics 
      profiling were performed to analyze the gut microbiota composition and 
      metabolites profile in the gut, respectively. Moreover, the mammalian target of 
      rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) / insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) / 
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) / protein kinase B (AKT) pathway was evaluated 
      via qPCR and western blot. RESULTS: Chemically characterized SHTB, in which six 
      markers were quantified, effectively alleviated glucose intolerance and IR, 
      ameliorated lipid metabolism dysfunction, and reduced inflammation. In addition, 
      16S rDNA sequencing found that SHTB reshaped the composition of intestinal flora, 
      as indicated by the enrichment of Akkermansia and Parabacteroides in both HFD-fed 
      and db/db mice. Moreover, SHTB enhanced the intestinal production of short-chain 
      fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched short-chain fatty acids (BSCFAs), and reduced 
      the levels of the fecal and circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The 
      IRS-1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was upregulated after treatment with SHTB. 
      CONCLUSION: Orally administration of SHTB effectively improved IR and reduced 
      hyperglycemia in mice. Treatment with SHTB regulated the gut 
      BCAAs-mTORC1/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT axis by enhancing the BCAAs catabolism in the gut, 
      which attenuated the deleterious effect of BCAAs on the IRS-1 signaling pathway.

TI  - Increased abundance of the adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology domain, 
      phosphotyrosine binding domain and leucine zipper motif (APPL1) in patients with 
      obesity and type 2 diabetes: evidence for altered adiponectin signalling.
PG  - 2122-31
LID - 10.1007/s00125-011-2173-x [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The adiponectin signalling pathway is largely unknown, but 
      recently the adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology domain, 
      phosphotyrosine binding domain and leucine zipper motif (APPL1), has been shown 
      to interact directly with adiponectin receptor (ADIPOR)1. APPL1 is present in 
      C2C12 myoblasts and mouse skeletal muscle, but its presence in human skeletal 
      muscle has not been investigated. METHODS: Samples from type 2 diabetic, and lean 
      and non-diabetic obese participants were analysed by: immunoprecipitation and 
      western blot; HPLC-electrospray ionisation (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis; 
      peak area analysis by MS; HPLC-ESI-MS/MS/MS analysis; and RT-PCR analysis of 
      APPL1 mRNA. RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation and western blot indicated a band 
      specific to APPL1. Tryptic digestion and HPLC-ESI-MS analysis of whole-muscle 
      homogenate APPL1 unambiguously identified APPL1 with 56% sequence coverage. Peak 
      area analysis by MS validated western blot results, showing APPL1 levels to be 
      significantly increased in type 2 diabetic and obese as compared with lean 
      participants. Targeted phosphopeptide analysis by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS/MS showed that 
      APPL1 was phosphorylated specifically on Ser(401). APPL1 mRNA expression was 
      significantly increased in obese and type 2 diabetic participants as compared 
      with lean participants. After bariatric surgery in morbidly obese participants 
      with subsequent weight loss, skeletal muscle APPL1 abundance was significantly 
      reduced (p < 0.05) in association with an increase in plasma adiponectin 
      (p < 0.01), increased levels of ADIPOR1 (p < 0.05) and increased muscle 
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: APPL1 abundance is significantly higher in type 2 
      diabetic muscle; APPL1 is phosphorylated in vivo on Ser(401). Improvements in 
      hyperglycaemia and hypoadiponectinaemia following weight loss are associated with 
      reduced skeletal muscle APPL1, and increased plasma adiponectin levels and muscle 
      AMPK phosphorylation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the mitochondrial content, 
      and the oxidative and nitrosative stress of the placenta in women with 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Full-term placentas from GDM and 
      healthy pregnancies were collected following informed consent. The lipid 
      peroxidation (TBARS) and oxidized protein (carbonyls) levels were determined by 
      spectrophotometry, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), subunit IV of cytochrome oxidase 
      (COX4), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 
      actin were determined by western blot, whereas ATPase activity was performed by 
      determining the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption using a High-performance 
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. RESULTS: TBARS and carbonyls levels were 
      lower in the placentas of women with GDM compared with the normal placentas 
      (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Also, 3-NT/actin and AMPK/actin ratios 
      were higher in GDM placentas than in the normal placentas (p = 0.03 and 
      p = 0.012, respectively). Whereas COX4/actin ratio and ATPase activity were 
      similar between GDM placentas and those controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest 
      that placentas with GDM are more protected against oxidative damage, but are more 
      susceptible to nitrosative damage as compared to normal placentas. Moreover, the 
      increased expression levels of AMPK in GDM placentas suggest that AMPK might have 
      a role in maintaining the mitochondrial biogenesis at normal levels. TRIAL

      the PI3K-AKT pathway and oxidative stress: Network pharmacology and experimental 
      evidence.
PG  - e6042

AB  - The Lingguizhugan decoction (LGZGD) is a promising traditional Chinese medicine 
      for the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, its bioactive 
      compounds and therapeutic mechanisms remain unknown. The main chemical 
      composition of LGZGD was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of LGZGD against 
      GDM were elucidated through network pharmacology and molecular docking. The 
      therapeutic efficacy and targets of LGZGD were further confirmed via an in vitro 
      GDM model (high glucose [HG]-treated HTR-8/SVneo cells). Four compounds of LGZGD, 
      namely, cinnamaldehyde, glycyrrhizic acid, 2-atractylenolide, and pachymic acid, 
      were detected. A total of 26 targets for LGZGD treating GDM were obtained, which 
      were mainly involved in oxidative stress and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. The 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network unveiled that AKT1, TLR4, TP53, and 
      NOS3 were hub therapeutic targets. Molecular docking showed that these targets 
      had strong affinity with key compounds. In vitro experiments confirmed that LGZGD 
      treatment promoted HG-induced cell viability, migration, and invasion ability 
      while inhibited the apoptosis rate and oxidative stress. Mechanically, western 
      blot revealed that LGZGD may protect HG-treated cells by activating the PI3K-AKT 
      pathway and suppressing TLR4 expression. Our study preliminarily explored the 
      mechanism of LGZGD in GDM treatment, providing a scientific basis for the 
      clinical application of LGZGD.

AB  - Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a common and severe complication of 
      diabetes. There is a large need to identify the effective and safety strategies 
      on diabetic cardiovascular disease (DCVD). 9-PAHSA is a novel endogenous fatty 
      acid, and has been reported to reduce blood glucose levels and attenuate 
      inflammation. We aim to evaluate the effects of 9-PAHSA on DCVD and investigate 
      the possible mechanisms underlying it. Firstly, serum 9-PAHSA levels in human 
      were detected by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Then 9-PAHSA was synthesized and purified. 
      The synthesized 9-PAHSA was gavaged to db/db mice with 50 mg/kg for 4 weeks. The 
      carotid arterial plaque and cardiac structure was assessed by ultrasound. Cardiac 
      autophagy was tested by western blot analysis, electron microscope and iTRAQ. The 
      results showed that 9-PAHSA, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
      was significantly lower than that in non-diabetic subjects. Administration of 
      9-PAHSA for 2 weeks reduced blood glucose levels. Ultrasound observed that 
      continue administration of 9-PAHSA for 4 weeks ameliorated carotid vascular 
      calcification, and attenuated myocardial hypertrophy and dysfunction in db/db 
      mice. Electron microscopy showed continue 9-PAHSA treatment significantly 
      increased autolysosomes, while dramatically decreased greases in the myocardial 
      cells of the db/db mice. Moreover, iTRAQ analysis exhibited that continue 9-PAHSA 
      treatment upregulated BAG3 and HSPB8. Furthermore, western blot analysis 
      confirmed that 9-PAHSA down-regulated Akt/mTOR and activated PI3KIII/BECN1 
      complex in diabetic myocardium. Thus, 9-PAHSA benefits DCVD in diabetic mice by 
      ameliorating carotid vascular calcification, promoting autophagic flux and 
      reducing myocardial hypertrophy.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Panax japonicus C. A. Meye (PJ) has unique 
      effects on diseases by "qi" stagnation and blood stasis in ancient. Modern 
      studies have shown that PJ can treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD) caused by 
      deficiency and blood stasis. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study evaluated the potential 
      effects of PJ on DKD, a microvascular complication, and investigated its possible 
      mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the chemical constituents of PJ 
      were analyzed by HPLC. In vivo studies, we constructed a diabetic mice model by 
      HDF combined with STZ, then administered PJ to diabetic mice for 6 weeks. Blood 
      lipid, BUN, 24h urine protein, and renal tissue HE staining were detected to 
      comprehensively evaluate the protective effect of PJ on DKD. Metabolomics 
      investigated the metabolic pathways influenced by PJ in the treatment of DKD. 
      Moreover, the potential targets and signal pathways were investigated using 
      network pharmacology. Finally, molecular docking predicts affinity of active 
      compounds and core targets, and western blotting was used to detect core target 
      expression levels. RESULTS: In vivo study, PJ can reduce hyperlipidemia, serum 
      BUN, and 24-h urinary protein in diabetic mice, and protect the pathological 
      changes in renal tissue. Metabolomics results showed that PJ had significant 
      regulatory effect on unsaturated fatty acids, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and 
      purine metabolism. Network pharmacology showed that MAPK1, MAPK8, Bcl-2, and 
      Caspase 3 were the core targets in PJ against DKD. Molecular docking revealed 
      that Bcl-2 and Caspase 3 have a strong affinity for Chikusetsusaponin Iva, 
      Ginsenoside Rb1, and Ginsenoside Rg1. Moreover, when compared to the model group, 
      the PJ group had higher levels of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 and lower levels 
      of pro-apoptosis protein Caspase 3. CONCLUSION: PJ can reduce blood lipids, 
      regulate the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and purine metabolism, 
      thereby alleviating the renal injury of diabetic mice. Moreover, it can regulate 
      the Bcl-2/caspase 3 apoptosis signaling pathway to prevent the apoptosis of renal 
      cells and protect the renal function of diabetic mice.

TI  - Immunoregulatory Effect of Acanthopanax trifoliatus (L.) Merr. Polysaccharide on 
      T1DM Mice.
PG  - 2629-2639
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S309851 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acanthopanax trifoliatus (L.) Merr. is a medicinal plant found in 
      Southeast Asia, and its young leaves and shoots are consumed as a vegetable. The 
      main bioactive components of this herb are polysaccharides that have significant 
      anti-diabetic effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoregulatory 
      effect of A. trifoliatus (L.) Merr. polysaccharide (ATMP) on a mouse model of 
      type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). METHODS: The monosaccharide composition and mean 
      molecular mass of ATMP were determined by HPLC and HPGPC. T1DM was induced in 
      mice using STZ, and 35, 70 and 140mg/kg ATMP was administered daily via the 
      intragastric route for six weeks. Untreated and metformin-treated positive 
      control groups were also included. The body weight of the mice, food and water 
      intake and fasting glucose levels were monitored throughout the 6-week regimen. 
      Histological changes in the pancreas and spleen were analyzed by H&E staining. 
      Oral glucose tolerance was evaluated with the appropriate test. Peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) mRNA and protein levels in the spleen 
      were measured by quantitative real time PCR and Western blotting. IL-10, IFN-γ 
      and insulin levels in the sera were determined by ELISA. The CD4(+) and CD8(+)T 
      cells in spleen tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: 
      ATMP and metformin significantly decreased fasting blood glucose, and the food 
      and water intake after 6 weeks of treatment. In contrast, serum insulin levels, 
      glucose tolerance and body weight improved considerably in the high and 
      medium-dose ATMP and metformin groups. T1DM was associated with pancreatic and 
      splenic tissue damage. The high dose (140mg/kg) of ATMP reduced infiltration of 
      inflammatory cells into the pancreas and restored the structure of islet β-cells 
      in the diabetic mice. Consistent with this, 35, 70 and 140mg/kg ATMP increased 
      IL-10 levels and decreased that of IFN-γ, thereby restoring the CD4(+)/CD8(+) and 
      Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio. At the molecular level, high-dose ATMP up-regulated PPARγ 
      in the splenic cells. CONCLUSION: ATMP exerts a hypoglycemic effect in diabetic 
      mice by restoring the immune balance in the spleen.

      of insulin resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Plasma concentrations of bilirubin, a product of heme 
      catabolism formed by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA), inversely associate with the 
      risk of metabolic diseases including hepatic steatosis and diabetes mellitus in 
      humans. Bilirubin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and may also 
      regulate insulin signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 
      (PPARα) activity. However, a causal link between bilirubin and metabolic diseases 
      remains to be established. Here, we used the global Bvra gene knockout 
      (Bvra(-/-)) mouse as a model of deficiency in bilirubin to assess its role in 
      metabolic diseases. APPROACH & RESULTS: We fed mice fat-rich diets to induce 
      hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Bile pigments were measured by 
      LC-MS/MS, and hepatic lipids by LC-MS/MS (non-targeted lipidomics), HPLC-UV and 
      Oil-Red-O staining. Oxidative stress was evaluated measuring F(2)-isoprostanes by 
      GC-MS. Glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were verified by glucose and 
      insulin tolerance tests, ex vivo and in vivo glucose uptake, and Western blotting 
      for insulin signaling. Compared with wild type littermates, Bvra(-/-) mice 
      contained negligible bilirubin in plasma and liver, and they had comparable 
      glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, Bvra(-/-) mice exhibited an 
      inflamed and fatty liver phenotype, accompanied by hepatic accumulation of 
      oxidized triacylglycerols and F(2)-isoprostanes, in association with depletion of 
      α-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol supplementation reversed the hepatic phenotype and 
      observed biochemical changes in Bvra(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests 
      that BVRA deficiency renders mice susceptible to oxidative stress-induced hepatic 
      steatosis in the absence of insulin resistance.

TI  - Jia-Wei-Jiao-Tai-Wan ameliorates type 2 diabetes by improving β cell function and 
      reducing insulin resistance in diabetic rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Jia-Wei-Jiao-Tai-Wan (JWJTW), composed of Jiao-Tai-Wan (Cinnamomum 
      cassia and Rhizoma coptidis) and other antidiabetic herbs, including Astragalus 
      membranaceus, Herba Gynostemmatis, Radix Puerariae Lobatae, Folium Mori and Semen 
      Trigonellae, is widely used to treat diabetes and has demonstrated a curative 
      effect in the clinic, but the potential mechanism is unknown. This study aimed to 
      explore the effects of JWJTW on diabetic rats and to clarify the underlying 
      mechanism. METHODS: JWJTW was prepared, and the main components contained in the 
      formula were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
      fingerprint analysis. Diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and a 
      high-sucrose-high-fat diet were treated with two concentrations of JWJTW (1.025 
      and 2.05 g/kg/d) for 100 days. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin 
      release test (IRT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed to measure the 
      glycometabolism of the diabetic rats at the end of the treatment period. Blood 
      was collected to determine the serum lipid levels of the diabetic rats. Nitric 
      oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione 
      peroxidase (GSH-px) were detected in pancreas homogenates to analyze the 
      oxidative stress in the pancreata of diabetic rats, and the expression levels of 
      pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) and insulin in the pancreas were 
      tested by Western blot to measure pancreatic islet function. In addition, Western 
      blots were used to measure the expression of proteins related to the insulin 
      signaling pathway in skeletal muscle of the diabetic rats. RESULTS: The results 
      showed that the administration of JWJTW could ameliorate impairments in glucose 
      tolerance, insulin release function and insulin tolerance in diabetic rats. JWJTW 
      could also dose-dependently reduce serum lipid levels in diabetic rats. JWJTW 
      restrained oxidative stress by decreasing the expression of NO and MDA and 
      increasing the expression of SOD and GSH-px. JWJTW improved the function of 
      pancreatic β cells by increasing PDX-1 and insulin expression. In addition, JWJTW 
      restored the impaired insulin signaling; upregulated phospho-insulin receptor 
      (pInsR) expression, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) tyrosine phosphorylation, 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (p85), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) 
      expression; and downregulated the serine phosphorylation of IRS. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study suggests that JWJTW can ameliorate type 2 diabetes by improving β cell 
      function and reducing insulin resistance in diabetic rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of exercise training on insulin sensitivity and 
      plasma ceramides in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Twenty-four 
      adults with obesity and normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 14) or diabetes 
      (n = 10) were studied before and after a 12-week supervised exercise-training 
      program (5 days/week, 1 h/day, 80-85% of maximum heart rate). Changes in body 
      composition were assessed using hydrostatic weighing and computed tomography. 
      Peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity was assessed by a 40 mU/m(2) /min 
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Plasma ceramides (C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, 
      C20:0, C24:0, and C24:1) were quantified using electrospray ionization tandem 
      mass spectrometry after separation with HPLC. RESULTS: Plasma ceramides were 
      similar for the subjects with obesity and NGT and the subjects with diabetes, 
      despite differences in glucose tolerance. Exercise significantly reduced body 
      weight and adiposity and increased peripheral insulin sensitivity in both groups 
      (P < 0.05). In addition, plasma C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, and C24:0 ceramide levels 
      were reduced in all subjects following the intervention (P < 0.05). Decreases in 
      total (r = -0.51, P = 0.02) and C14:0 (r = -0.56, P = 0.009) ceramide were 
      negatively correlated with the increase in insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Ceramides are linked to exercise training-induced improvements in insulin 
      sensitivity, and plasma C14:0 ceramide may provide a specific target for 
      investigating lipid-related insulin resistance in obesity and T2D.

AB  - Hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) plays a crucial role in diabetes management. We aimed 
      to evaluate the analytical performance of a new enzymatic method kit for HbA(1c) 
      measurement. The performance of the enzymatic method, including precision, 
      accuracy, and linearity, was evaluated. Moreover, the interference effect from 
      conventional interferents, Hb derivatives, Hb variants, and common drugs were 
      assessed. In addition, the agreement of HbA(1c) results was compared between 
      enzymatic methods, cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 
      and immunoassays. The intra-assay, between-assay, and total precision of HbA(1c) 
      were all lower than 2%. HbA(1c) showed good linearity within the range of 
      3.96-20.23%. The enzymatic assay yielded results consistent with the external 
      quality control samples, with a bias of less than ± 6% from the target values. 
      The enzymatic method showed no interference from bilirubin, intralipid, vitamin 
      C, Hb derivatives, common Hb variants, as well as antipyretic analgesics and 
      hypoglycemic drugs. The HbA(1c) results of the enzymatic assay showed good 
      agreement and accuracy compared to those obtained from the HPLC method and the 
      immunoassay. The enzymatic method kit performed on the BS-600M chemistry analyzer 
      is a reliable and robust method for measuring HbA(1c). It is suitable for routine 
      practice in clinical chemistry laboratories.

TI  - Mitochondrial respiration in thoracic perivascular adipose tissue of diabetic 
      mice.
PG  - 169-184
LID - 10.1530/JOE-21-0446 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thoracic perivascular adipose tissue (tPVAT) has a phenotype 
      resembling brown AT. Dysfunctional tPVAT appears to be linked to vascular 
      dysfunction. METHODS: We evaluated uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression by 
      Western blot, oxidative stress by measuring lipid peroxidation, the antioxidant 
      capacity by HPLC and spectrophotometry, and mitochondrial respiration by 
      high-resolution respirometry (HRR) in tPVAT, compared to inguinal white AT 
      (iWAT), obtained from non-diabetic (NDM) and streptozocin-induced diabetic 
      (STZ-DM) mice. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by HRR using protocol 1: 
      complex I and II oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and protocol 2: fatty acid 
      oxidation (FAO) OXPHOS. OXPHOS capacity in tPVAT was also evaluated after UCP1 
      inhibition by guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP). RESULTS: UCP1 expression was higher 
      in tPVAT when compared with iWAT in both NDM and STZ-DM mice. The malondialdehyde 
      concentration was elevated in tPVAT from STZ-DM compared to NDM mice. Glutathione 
      peroxidase and reductase activities, as well as reduced glutathione levels, were 
      not different between tPVAT from NDM and STZ-DM mice but were lower compared to 
      iWAT of STZ-DM mice. OXPHOS capacity of tPVAT was significantly decreased after 
      UCP1 inhibition by GDP in protocol 1. While there were no differences in the 
      OXPHOS capacity between NDM and STZ-DM mice in protocol 1, it was increased in 
      STZ-DM compared to NDM mice in protocol 2. Moreover, complex II- and FAO-linked 
      respiration were elevated in STZ-DM mice under UCP1 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pharmacological therapies could be targeted to modulate UCP1 activity with a 
      significant impact in the uncoupling of mitochondrial bioenergetics in tPVAT.

TI  - Activation of 5-HT1A Receptors Normalizes the Overexpression of Presynaptic 
      5-HT1A Receptors and Alleviates Diabetic Neuropathic Pain.
LID - 10.3390/ijms241814334 [doi]
LID - 14334
AB  - Neuropathic pain is a well-documented phenomenon in experimental and clinical 
      diabetes; however, current treatment is unsatisfactory. Serotoninergic-containing 
      neurons are key components of the descending autoinhibitory pathway, and a 
      decrease in their activity may contribute at least in part to diabetic 
      neuropathic pain (DNP). A streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rat was used as a model 
      for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Pain transmission was evaluated using 
      well-established nociceptive-based techniques, including the Hargreaves 
      apparatus, cold plate and dynamic plantar aesthesiometer. Using qRT-PCR, Western 
      blotting, immunohistochemistry, and HPLC-based techniques, we also measured in 
      the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system of diabetic animals the 
      expression and localization of 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AR), levels of key enzymes 
      involved in the synthesis and degradation of tryptophan and 5-HT, including 
      tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph-2), tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (Tdo), indoleamine 
      2,3-dioxygenase 1 (Ido1) and Ido2. Moreover, spinal concentrations of 5-HT, 
      5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, a metabolite of 5-HT) and quinolinic acid 
      (QA, a metabolite of tryptophan) were also quantified. Diabetic rats developed 
      thermal hyperalgesia and cold/mechanical allodynia, and these behavioral 
      abnormalities appear to be associated with the upregulation in the levels of 
      expression of critical molecules related to the serotoninergic nervous system, 
      including presynaptic 5-HT1AR and the enzymes Tph-2, Tdo, Ido1 and Ido2. 
      Interestingly, the level of postsynaptic 5-HT1AR remains unaltered in STZ-induced 
      T1DM. Chronic treatment of diabetic animals with 
      8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a selective 5-HT1AR agonist, 
      downregulated the upregulation of neuronal presynaptic 5-HT1AR, increased spinal 
      release of 5-HT (↑ 5-HIAA/5-HT) and reduced the concentration of QA, decreased 
      mRNA expression of Tdo, Ido1 and Ido2, arrested neuronal degeneration and 
      ameliorated pain-related behavior as exemplified by thermal hyperalgesia and 
      cold/mechanical allodynia. These data show that 8-OH-DPAT alleviates DNP and 
      other components of the serotoninergic system, including the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT 
      and 5-HT1AR, and could be a useful therapeutic agent for managing DNP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protection of pancreatic islet cells against dysfunction or death by 
      regulating autophagy is considered to be an effective method for treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Morus alba leaves (mulberry leaves), a popular 
      herbal medicine, have been used for prevention of T2DM since ancient times. 
      PURPOSE: This study aimed to clarify whether Morus alba leaves ethanol extract 
      (MLE) could protect islet cells in vivo and in vitro by regulating autophagy in 
      T2DM, and explore the possible mechanism of action. METHODS: The main chemical 
      constituents in MLE were analyzed by HPLC. The T2DM rat model was induced via 
      high-fat diet combined with peritoneal injection of low-dose streptozotocin, and 
      MLE was administered by oral gavage. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and plasma 
      insulin were measured, and homeostatic model assessment of β cell function 
      (HOMA-β) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined. The histomorphology of 
      pancreas islets was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. In palmitic 
      acid (PA)-stressed INS-1 rat insulinoma cells, cell viability was assayed by an 
      MTT method. Expression of the autophagy-related proteins LC3 I/II, p62, p-AMPK 
      and p-mTOR in islet tissues and INS-1 cells was evaluated by western blotting or 
      immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: The four main chemical constituents in 
      MLE were identified as chlorogenic acid, rutin, isoquercitrin and quercitrin. MLE 
      ameliorated hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia of T2DM rats with 
      prominent therapeutic effect. Further study indicated that MLE observably 
      improved islet function, alleviated islet injury of T2DM rats, and inhibited 
      PA-induced INS-1 cell death. On the other hand, MLE significantly induced 
      autophagy in islet cells both in vivo and in vitro, and autophagy inhibitors 
      abolished its therapeutic effect on T2DM rats and protective effect on islet 
      cells. Apart from this, MLE markedly activated the AMPK/mTOR pathway in INS-1 
      cells, and the AMPK inhibitor prevented the autophagy induction ability of MLE. 
      CONCLUSION: Together, MLE could protect islet cells against dysfunction and death 
      by inducing AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy in T2DM, and these findings provide a 
      new perspective for understanding the treatment mechanism of Morus alba leaves 
      against T2DM.

AB  - The polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum (GLP) were prepared using boiling 
      water extraction methods. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed 
      that GLP was composed of five monosaccharides and disaccharides, including 
      xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose, were identified for 
      polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum. The relative molar percentages of xylose, 
      fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose in polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum 
      were 0.4%, 14.4%, 12.8%, 0.7% and 50.9%, respectively. GLP (100, 200, 300mg/kg) 
      was administered to diabetic rats. Effect of extract on antioxidant enzymes 
      activities and lipid peroxidation levels of pancreas was studied in diabetic 
      rats. The mechanism of anti-apoptosis of GLP in STZ-induced diabetic rats was 
      further investigated using Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and protein. Result showed that GLP 
      extracts effectively reduced oxidative injury and inhibited apoptosis by 
      increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and modifying bcl-2 expression and 
      bax/bcl-2 ratio. The GLP extract exhibited potent antioxidant effect in vivo. The 
      effect can contribute, at least in part, to the inhibition of apoptosis.

TI  - Gynura procumbens (Lour.) Merr. extract attenuates monocyte adherence to 
      endothelial cells through suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gynura procumbens (Lour.) Merr. (GP) is a 
      herbaceous plant that grows in Malaysia and other parts of Southeast Asia. The 
      herb is consumed as a remedy for various inflammatory-associated diseases, such 
      as cancer, rheumatism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. 
      Scientific studies demonstrate that GP extract possesses cardioprotective and 
      anti-inflammatory effects. Cardiovascular disease is mainly caused by 
      atherosclerosis, and inflammation plays a major role in all phases of 
      atherosclerosis. The early inflammatory events in atherogenesis are the 
      activation of endothelial cells and the recruitment of monocytes. AIM OF THE 
      STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of 80% ethanol extract 
      of GP leaves (GPE) on the adherence of monocytes to the activated human 
      endothelial cells and its underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Qualitative 
      and quantitative analyses of the extract were carried out by using a validated 
      HPLC and UHPLC-MS/MS methods. The MTT test was used to select the range of 
      concentration of extract for this study. The effect of GPE on TNF-α-induced 
      monocyte-endothelial interaction was determined by the in vitro adhesion assay. 
      Expression of cell surface proteins (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and phosphorylation of 
      nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were determined by western blot, while expression 
      of a chemokine (MCP-1) was identified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
      RESULTS: HPLC and UHPLC-MS/MS analyses indicated that GPE contained chlorogenic 
      acid, nicotiflorin and astragalin as the major compounds. GPE at 20, 40 and 
      60 μg/mL concentrations showed a significant reduction in monocyte adherence to 
      endothelial cells and expression of ICAM-1 and MCP-1. However, only GPE at 
      concentrations of 40 and 60 μg/mL was able to reduce VCAM-1 expression. 
      Furthermore, GPE significantly inhibited IKKα/β, IκBα, NF-κB phosphorylation and 
      NF-κB translocation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, GPE may inhibit monocyte 
      adherence to the activated endothelial cells and expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and 
      MCP-1, which are important proteins for monocyte-endothelial interaction, by 
      suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway. The results of this study support the 
      traditional use of GPE to counteract inflammation-associated diseases and suggest 
      that GP can be a potential source for bioactive compounds for the development of 
      anti-inflammatory agents to prevent atherosclerosis.

TI  - Protein crosslinking by the Maillard reaction: dicarbonyl-derived imidazolium 
      crosslinks in aging and diabetes.
PG  - 98-104
AB  - alpha-Dicarbonyl compounds that arise from various metabolic pathways react with 
      proteins to form a variety of adducts in a reaction known as the Maillard 
      reaction. These adducts are collectively known as advanced glycation end products 
      or AGEs. Methylglyoxal (MG) and glyoxal (GXL) are two such dicarbonyls. They 
      react with proteins to produce lysine-lysine imidazolium crosslinking AGEs. The 
      imidazolium crosslinks derived from MG (MOLD-methylglyoxal-lysine dimer) and GXL 
      (GOLD-glyoxal-lysine dimer) are present in human tissue proteins. In this study, 
      we report an HPLC method for the simultaneous quantification of GOLD and MOLD in 
      biological specimens. The method consists of reverse-phase HPLC of 
      acid-hydrolyzed proteins, collection of eluate-containing imidazoliums, 
      phenylisothiocyanate derivatization, followed by a second reverse-phase HPLC. 
      This method was linear for both the imidazolium compounds in the range of 0.5-300 
      pmol. The levels of GOLD and MOLD in aging lenses (20 to 80 years) were trace-8.4 
      pmol and 15-93 pmol per milligram of protein, respectively. Cataractous lenses 
      showed significantly higher levels of both GOLD and MOLD (mean +/- SD, 14.5 +/- 
      1.8 and 141 +/- 18.4 pmol per milligram of protein, P < 0.05). Brunescent lenses 
      had the highest levels of imidazolium crosslinks (GOLD, 18.36 +/- 2.5; and MOLD, 
      179. 2 +/- 32.3 pmol per milligram of protein, P < 0.05). The GOLD and MOLD 
      levels were higher in diabetic plasma proteins when compared to that of normal 
      (GOLD, 17.5 +/- 6.34 pmol per milligram of protein vs 43.5 +/- 15.96 pmol per 
      milligram of protein; and MOLD, 172.5 +/- 32. 53 pmol per milligram of protein vs 
      273 +/- 62.67 pmol per milligram of protein, P < 0.05). GOLD and MOLD are 
      significant in terms of tissue damage in aging and diabetes because they 
      represent protein crosslinking by compounds that are major precursors of AGEs. 
      Our method can be used for quantification of imidazolium crosslinks in tissue 
      proteins to assess alpha-dicarbonyl-mediated protein damage in vivo.

TI  - The Influence of Coumestrol on Sphingolipid Signaling Pathway and Insulin 
      Resistance Development in Primary Rat Hepatocytes.
LID - 10.3390/biom11020268 [doi]
LID - 268
AB  - Coumestrol is a phytoestrogen widely known for its anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, 
      and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, it gets a lot of attention as a potential 
      agent in the nutritional therapy of diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
      In our study, we evaluated whether coumestrol affects insulin resistance 
      development via the sphingolipid signaling pathway in primary rat hepatocytes. 
      The cells were isolated from the male Wistar rat's liver with the use of 
      collagenase perfusion. Next, we incubated the cells with the presence or absence 
      of palmitic acid and/or coumestrol. Additionally, some groups were incubated with 
      insulin. The sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by HPLC whereas the 
      expression of all the proteins was evaluated by Western blot. Coumestrol markedly 
      reduced the accumulation of sphingolipids, namely, ceramide and sphinganine 
      through noticeable inhibition of the ceramide de novo synthesis pathway in 
      insulin-resistant hepatocytes. Moreover, coumestrol augmented the expression of 
      fatty acid transport proteins, especially FATP5 and FAT/CD36, which also were 
      responsible for excessive sphingolipid accumulation. Furthermore, coumestrol 
      altered the sphingolipid salvage pathway, which was observed as the excessive 
      deposition of the sphingosine-1-phosphate and sphingosine. Our study clearly 
      showed that coumestrol ameliorated hepatic insulin resistance in primary rat 
      hepatocytes. Thus, we believe that our study may contribute to the discovery of 
      novel preventive and therapeutic methods for metabolic disorders.

AB  - Formaldehyde (FA) can be produced in the environment and by cell metabolism and 
      has been classified as a carcinogen in animals and humans. Metformin is the most 
      commonly used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin also has 
      potential benefit in cancer prevention and treatment. The aim of this study was 
      to determine whether metformin can directly react with FA and attenuate its 
      toxicity in vitro. Metformin was incubated at pH 7.4 and 37°C in the presence of 
      FA, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by UV spectrophotometry, 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry. 
      Fluorescence spectrophotometry, immunofluorescence, and western blot were used to 
      measure FA-induced bovine serum albumin (BSA) crosslinking and DNA damage in 
      HepG2 cells treated with or without metformin. According to the HPLC and mass 
      spectrometry data, we speculate that the reaction of metformin with FA (1:1) 
      initially results in the formation of a conjugated intermediate followed by the 
      subsequent generation of a stable six-membered ring structure. Correspondingly, 
      metformin attenuated FA-induced fluorescence in BSA as well as the aggregation of 
      γH2AX in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that metformin can protect protein 
      and DNA damage induced by FA at least partly through a direct reaction process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence demonstrating that the gut microbiota plays 
      a crucial role in multiple endocrine disorders, including diabetic cardiomyopathy 
      (DCM). Research shows that the Chinese herb reduces disease occurrence by 
      regulating gut microbiota. Zuogui Jiangtang Shuxin formula (ZGJTSXF), a Chinese 
      medicinal formula, has been clinically used for treatment of DCM for many years. 
      However, there is still no clear understanding of how ZGJTSXF treatment 
      contributes to the prevention and treatment of DCM through its interaction with 
      gut microbiota and metabolism. METHODS: In this study, mice models of DCM were 
      established, and ZGJTSXF's therapeutic effects were assessed. Specifically, serum 
      glycolipid, echocardiography, histological staining, myocardial apoptosis rate 
      were assessed. Using 16s rRNA sequencing and high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), we determined the impact of 
      ZGJTSXF on the structure of gut microbiota and content of its metabolite TMAO. 
      The mechanism of ZGJTSXF action on DCM was analyzed using quantitative real-time 
      PCR and western blots. RESULTS: We found that ZGJTSXF significantly ameliorated 
      DCM mice by modulating gut-heart axis: ZGJTSXF administration improved glycolipid 
      levels, heart function, cardiac morphological changes, inhibited cardiomyocytes 
      apoptosis, and regulate the gut microbiota in DCM mice. Specifically, ZGJTSXF 
      treatment reverse the significant changes in the abundance of certain genera 
      closely related to DCM phenotype, including Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella and 
      Alistipes. Furthermore, ZGJTSXF alleviated DCM in mice by blunting 
      TMAO/PERK/FoxO1 signaling pathway genes and proteins. CONCLUSION: ZGJTSXF 
      administration could ameliorate DCM mice by remodeling gut microbiota structure, 
      reducing serum TMAO generation and suppressing TMAO/PERK/FoxO1 signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: O-GlcNAcylation is an important mechanism of diabetic complication. 
      Retinoid homeostasis regulates cell-physiological functions through STRA6-retinol 
      signaling. Therefore, we investigated whether O-GlcNAcylation disrupted 
      STRA6-retinol signals in diabetes. METHODS: Immunoprecipitation and proximity 
      ligation assay were used to investigate O-GlcNAcylation of STRA6-retinol signals 
      in kidneys of db/db and ob/ob mice. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were 
      done for STRA6/CRBP1/LRAT/RALDH1/RARs pathway, GFAT, OGT, TGFβ(1) and collagen 1 
      level. HPLC and ELISA for retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid concentrations were 
      performed in vivo and vitro. RBP4 binding with STRA6 was measured in vitro. To 
      verify whether O-GlcNAcylation disrupted STRA6-retinol signals, treatment of TMG 
      and OSMI-1, transfection of OGA and OGT, and OGT siRNA were performed in HK-2 
      cells. RESULTS: STRA6 and RALDH1 were highly O-GlcNAc-modified in glomeruli and 
      tubules of db/db and ob/ob mice. RBP4, p-Try, p-JAK2, and p-STAT5 on STRA6 
      immunoprecipitate were reduced. Cellular retinol signals (CRBP1, LRAT, ADH, 
      retinol, retinal, RA, RARα, RARγ and RXRα) remarkably decreased in kidneys of 
      db/db, ob/ob mice and HG-cultured cells. TMG and OGT transfection induced 
      O-GlcNAcylation of STRA6 and RALDH1, repressed RBP4-bound STRA6, and retinol 
      signals in NG-cultured cells. OSMI-1, OGA transfection, and OGT silence reversed 
      O-GlcNAc-modification of STRA6 and RALDH1, and rescued the decrease of retinol 
      signals, and reversed the increase of TGFβ(1) and collagen 1 in HG-treated cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: O-GlcNAcylation significantly modified STRA6 and RALDH1, suppressed 
      RBP4 binding activity, and disrupted retinol signals in the kidney of diabetes. 
      GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study first indicates that STRA6-retinol signals were 
      directly disrupted by O-GlcNAcylation in diabetic kidney.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Metabolic syndrome is currently recognized as the 
      major cause of morbidity, with dramatic complications on life expectancy and 
      health status. Myrianthus arboreus is a medicinal plant traditionally used in 
      local communities as a safe remedy in treating diabetes and other metabolic 
      diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the impact of a 
      methanol extract of Myrianthus arboreus leaf (MAL) in a mice model of metabolic 
      syndrome induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) intake. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male 
      C57BL/6J mice were assigned to the following groups: control, obese control, and 
      obese treated with MAL extract (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Control mice 
      received a standard chow diet, while all obese mice were fed with HFD. Animal 
      weight and food consumption were periodically measured. At the end of the 
      treatment, fasting blood glucose and metabolic plasma analysis (insulin level, 
      triglycerides, and total cholesterol (TC)) were performed. The HFD-induced 
      inflammatory status and the expression of several obesity-related markers were 
      evaluated in liver and fat using qPCR and Western blot analysis. In addition, the 
      phytochemical composition of MAL was identified by GC-MS and HPLC-MS. RESULTS: 
      MAL administration significantly reduced body weight gain, basal glycemia, and 
      insulin resistance, and improved plasma lipid profile compared with HFD-fed mice. 
      Similarly, this extract improved the HFD-associated inflammatory status in mice 
      by gene expression modulation of different inflammatory markers involved in this 
      experimentally induced metabolic condition. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate 
      the novel applicability of MAL, thus suggesting it as a promising therapeutic 
      approach for the management of metabolic disorders.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yunvjian (YNJ), a traditional Chinese herbal 
      formula first reported in Jing Yue Quan Shu, is commonly used in the clinical 
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanism by which YNJ 
      affects T2DM remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to assess the 
      therapeutic effects of YNJ on T2DM and explore the potential mechanism involved. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to 
      identify the chemical compounds of YNJ. The anti-T2DM effects of YNJ were 
      observed in a high-fat diet/streptozotocin induced rat model. The type 2 diabetic 
      rats were prepared as follows: rats were fed a high-fat diet for four weeks and 
      then intraperitoneally injected with a low dose (30 mg/kg) of streptozotocin. YNJ 
      and the positive control metformin were used in these experiments. Biochemical 
      assays were implemented to determine the fasting blood glucose, glucose 
      tolerance, insulin sensitivity, serum lipid levels, and oxidative stress index of 
      the pancreas. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to assess 
      histopathological alterations in the pancreas. The mechanism by which YNJ affects 
      T2DM was evaluated in INS-1 cells treated with glucose and high sodium palmitate. 
      YNJ-supplemented serum was used in these experiments. Methyl thiazolyl 
      tetrazolium assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, Nile red staining, flow 
      cytometric analysis, and Western blotting were used to assess apoptosis, insulin 
      secretion, lipid accumulation, reactive oxygen species production, and protein 
      levels. RESULTS: Five major compounds were identified in YNJ. In high-fat 
      diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, YNJ-M notably decreased fasting blood 
      glucose and lipid levels; ameliorated glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and 
      islet morphology; reduced Malondialdehyde levels; and restored superoxide 
      dismutase activity in the pancreatic islets. Furthermore, the effect of YNJ-M was 
      significantly greater than that of YNJ-L, and YNJ-H had little effect on diabetic 
      rats. In vitro experiments revealed that YNJ-supplemented serum (10%, 15%, and 
      20%) dramatically suppressed apoptosis, mitigated intracellular lipid 
      accumulation and reduced intracellular oxidative stress levels in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Additionally, YNJ-supplemented serum increased the protein 
      expression of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, Heme oxygenase-1, and 
      superoxide dismutase 1 and inhibited the protein expression of Kelch-like 
      ECH-associated protein 1. CONCLUSION: YNJ ameliorates high-fat 
      diet/streptozotocin induced experimental T2DM. The underlying mechanism involves 
      reducing oxidative stress in pancreatic beta cells. The findings of this study 
      provide scientific justification for the application of the traditional medicine 
      YNJ in treating T2DM.

AB  - Pathological angiogenesis plays a major role in many disease processes, including 
      cancer and diabetic retinopathy. Antiangiogenic therapy is a potential management 
      for pathologic angiogenesis. The novel synthetic compound 221S-1a, derived from 
      captopril, tanshinol and borneol, may have antiangiogenic properties. On the 
      basis of MS, NMR and HPLC analysis, the structure of 221S-1a was identified. The 
      cellular uptake and metabolism of this compound was also observed. Next, the 
      antiangiogenic properties of 221S-1a were evaluated in tumor-xenograft and OIR 
      models in vivo. The inhibitory properties of 221S-1a on endothelial cell 
      proliferation, migration, tube formation and sprouting were detected in vitro. 
      Furthermore, 221S-1a induced G1/S phase arrest was detected by PI staining flow 
      cytometry analysis and Cyclin D, Cyclin E expression. 221S-1a inhibited ERK1/2 
      activation and nuclear translocation, in addition to downregulation of c-Myc, a 
      transcription factor that regulates cell cycle progression. Molecular docking 
      indicated the interaction of 221S-1a with the ATP-binding site of ERK2, leading 
      to the inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation and a concomitant inhibition of ERK1 
      phosphorylation. In conclusion, 221S-1a inhibited the G1/S phase transition by 
      blocking the ERK1/2/c-Myc pathway to reduce tumor and OIR retinal angiogenesis. 
      These novel findings suggest that 221S-1a is a potential pharmacologic candidate 
      for treating pathological angiogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The escalation of global population aging has accentuated the 
      prominence of senile diabetes mellitus (SDM) as a consequential public health 
      concern. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory cascades prevalent in 
      individuals with senile diabetes significantly amplify disease progression and 
      complication rates. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emerges as a pivotal 
      player in enhancing blood sugar homeostasis and retarding complication onset in 
      the clinical management of senile diabetes. Nonetheless, an evident research gap 
      persists regarding the integration of TCM's renal tonification pharmacological 
      mechanisms with experimental validation within the realm of senile diabetes 
      therapeutics. AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms 
      of action of New Shenqi Pills (SQP) in the treatment of SDM and make an 
      experimental assessment. METHODS: Network analysis is used to evaluate target 
      pathways related to SQP and SDM. Mitochondrial-related genes were obtained from 
      the MitoCarta3.0 database and intersected with the common target genes of the 
      disease and drugs, then constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
      making use of the GeneMANIA database. Representative compounds in the SQP were 
      quantitatively measured using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to ensure quality control and quantitative analysis of 
      the compounds. A type 2 diabetes mice (C57BL/6) model was used to investigate the 
      pharmacodynamics of SQP. The glucose lowering efficacy of SQP was assessed 
      through various metrics including body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG). To 
      elucidate the modulatory effects of SQP on pancreatic beta cell function, we 
      measured oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin histochemical staining and 
      tunel apoptosis detection, then assessed the insulin-mediated phosphoinositide 
      3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase A (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) 
      pathway in diabetic mice via Western blotting. Additionally, we observe the 
      structural changes of the nucleus, cytoplasmic granules and mitochondria of 
      pancreatic islet β cells. RESULTS: In this investigation, we identified a total 
      of 1876 genes associated with senile diabetes, 278 targets of SQP, and 166 
      overlapping target genes, primarily enriched in pathways pertinent to oxidative 
      stress response, peptide response, and oxygen level modulation. Moreover, an 
      intersection analysis involving 1,136 human mitochondrial genes and comorbidity 
      targets yielded 15 mitochondria-related therapeutic targets. Quality control 
      assessments and quantitative analyses of SQP revealed the predominant presence of 
      five compounds with elevated concentrations: Catalpol, Cinnamon Aldehyde, 
      Rehmanthin D, Trigonelline, and Paeonol Phenol. Vivo experiments demonstrated 
      notable findings. Relative to the control group, mice in the model group 
      exhibited significant increases in body weight and fasting blood glucose levels, 
      alongside decreased insulin secretion and heightened islet cell apoptosis. 
      Moreover, β-cells nuclear condensation and mitochondrial cristae disappearance 
      were observed, accompanied by reduced expression levels of p-GSK-3β protein in 
      islet cells (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Conversely, treatment groups administered SQP 
      and Rg displayed augmented expressions of the aforementioned protein markers (p < 
      0.05 or p < 0.01), alongside preserved mitochondrial cristae structure in islet β 
      cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SQP can ameliorate diabetes by 
      reducing islet cell apoptosis and resist oxidative stress. These insulin-mediated 
      PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway plays an important regulatory role in this process.

AB  - Calotropis procera is a perennial flowering plant of the Apocynaceae family, 
      traditionally used in medicine to treat various ailments. Recent investigations 
      have revealed its potential therapeutic activities such as anti-inflammatory, 
      gastroprotective, analgesic, anti-obesity, and anti-diabetic properties. RP-HPLC 
      qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the phenolic acids and flavonoids in 
      the ethanolic extract at two different wavelengths, 280 and 330 nm. In addition, 
      total phenolic and flavonoid contents were measured via spectrophotometric 
      determination in addition to the antioxidant activity. The antiproliferative 
      effects of C. procera were investigated on two cancer cell lines: human colon 
      (HCT-116) and breast (MCF-7) cancer. Several methods were utilised to analyse the 
      effectiveness of the plant extract on the cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle 
      progression, genes involved in the cell cycle, and protein expression profiles of 
      HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells. These included the MTT assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI, 
      analysis of the cell cycle, and Western blot. Results indicated that ferulic and 
      caffeic acids were the major compounds at λ(max) 280 nm (1.374% and 0.561%, 
      respectively), while the major compounds at λ(max) 325 nm were kaempferol and 
      luteolin (1.036% and 0.512%, respectively). The ethanolic extract had 
      significantly higher antioxidant activity (80 ± 2.3%) compared to ascorbic acid 
      (90 ± 3.1%). C. procera extract exhibited dose-dependent cell growth inhibition, 
      with an estimated IC(50) of 50 μg/mL for MCF-7 and 55 μg/mL for HCT-116 cells at 
      24 h. Annexin V-FITC/PI confirmed the induction of apoptosis. Remarkably, cell 
      cycle arrest occurred at the sub-G1 phase in MCF-7 cells, while in HCT-116 cells, 
      it was observed at the G2-M phase. The sub-G1 arrest was associated with 
      dysregulation of Akt, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR proteins, as confirmed by the 
      Western blot analysis, while downregulation of CDK1, cyclin B1, and survivin 
      caused G2-M arrest.

AB  - The plant genus Eremophila is endemic to Australia and widespread in arid 
      regions. Root bark extract of Eremophila longifolia (R.Br.) F.Muell. 
      (Scrophulariaceae) was investigated by LC-PDA-HRMS, and dereplication suggested 
      the presence of a series of diterpenoids. Using a combination of preparative- and 
      analytical-scale HPLC separation as well as extensive 1D and 2D NMR analysis, the 
      structures of 12 hitherto unreported serrulatane diterpenoids, eremolongine A-L, 
      were established. These structures included serrulatanes with unusual side chain 
      modifications to form hitherto unseen skeletons with, e.g., cyclopentane, 
      oxepane, and bicyclic hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]furan moieties. Serrulatane 
      diterpenoids in Eremophila have recently been shown to originate from a common 
      biosynthetic precursor with conserved stereochemical configuration, and this was 
      used for tentative assignment of the relative and absolute configuration of the 
      isolated compounds. Triple high-resolution α-glucosidase/α-amylase/PTP1B 
      inhibition profiling demonstrated that several of the eremolongines had weak 
      inhibitory activity towards targets important for management of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Apples are rich sources of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) which are 
      the major and most prominent triterpenes in the peel of an apple. Pentacyclic 
      triterpenes are ideal nutraceuticals due to their ability to reduce the risk of 
      many life-threatening diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and diabetes. This 
      study was to determine the content of UA and OA in the apple peel extract from 
      different cultivars grown in South Africa as well as the correlation of their 
      content level with antioxidant capacity. Quantitative analysis of UA and OA in 
      apple peels from three cultivars; red delicious (RD), royal gala (RG) and granny 
      smith (GS) apples was carried out using HPLC and their antioxidant capacity was 
      analyzed using the DPPH assay. The RD showed the highest content of UA and OA 
      (248.02 ± 0.08 µg/ml and 110.00 ± 0.08 µg/ml respectively) in the apple peel 
      extract and also displayed a significantly high level of antioxidant capacity 
      (97.3 ± 0.40%; p < 0.0001) compared to the RG and GS cultivars. A strong positive 
      correlation was noted between the UA, OA and antioxidant capacities of all the 
      cultivars. Only the RD cultivar showed a significant correlation though; UA (r = 
      0.9570; p = 0.0027) and OA (r = 0.8503; p = 0.0319). This study demonstrated that 
      the RD and RG apple peels possess the highest UA and OA content which invariably 
      increases their antioxidant activities compared to GS apple. Thus, both apple 
      cultivars would be useful and recommended for food consumption and nutraceuticals 
      values to improve human health.

TI  - Carnosine Catalyzes the Formation of the Oligo/Polymeric Products of 
      Methylglyoxal.
PG  - 713-726
LID - 10.1159/000488727 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Reactive dicarbonyl compounds, such as methylglyoxal (MG), 
      contribute to diabetic complications. MG-scavenging capacities of carnosine and 
      anserine, which have been shown to mitigate diabetic nephropathy, were evaluated 
      in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: MG-induced cell toxicity was characterized by MTT 
      and MG-H1-formation, scavenging abilities by Western Blot and NMR spectroscopies, 
      cellular carnosine transport by qPCR and microplate luminescence and carnosine 
      concentration by HPLC. RESULTS: In vitro, carnosine and anserine dose-dependently 
      reduced N-carboxyethyl lysine (CEL) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 
      formation. NMR studies revealed the formation of oligo/polymeric products of MG 
      catalyzed by carnosine or anserine. MG toxicity (0.3-1 mM) was dose-dependent for 
      podocytes, tubular and mesangial cells whereas low MG levels (0.2 mM) resulted in 
      increased cell viability in podocytes (143±13%, p<0.001) and tubular cells 
      (129±3%, p<0.001). Incubation with carnosine/anserine did not reduce MG-induced 
      toxicity, independent of incubation times and across large ranges of MG to 
      carnosine/anserine ratios. Cellular carnosine uptake was low (<0.1% in 20 hours) 
      and cellular carnosine concentrations remained unaffected. The putative carnosine 
      transporter PHT1 along with the taurine transporter (TauT) was expressed in all 
      cell types while PEPT1, PEPT2 and PHT2, also belonging to the proton-coupled 
      oligopeptide transporter (POT) family, were only expressed in tubular cells. 
      CONCLUSION: While carnosine and anserine catalyze the formation of MG 
      oligo/polymers, the molar ratios required for protection from MG-induced cellular 
      toxicity are not achievable in renal cells. The effect of carnosine in vivo, to 
      mitigate diabetic nephropathy may therefore be independent upon its ability to 
      scavenge MG and/or carnosine is mainly acting extracellularly.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Morus alba L. (Sangzhi) alkaloids (SZ-A) tablets 
      have been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration for T2DM 
      treatment. Our previous study (Liu et al., 2021) revealed that SZ-A protected 
      against diabetes and inflammation in KKAy mice. However, the mechanism and 
      components in SZ-A exerting anti-inflammatory effects are unclear. AIM OF THE 
      STUDY: Investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of SZ-A on inflammation, 
      and identify anti-inflammatory active components in SZ-A. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The major ingredients in SZ-A were analyzed by HPLC and sulfuric acid - anthrone 
      spectrophotometry. The inhibitory activities of SZ-A on lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS)-stimulated inflammation were determined in bone marrow-derived macrophage 
      (BMDM) and RAW264.7 cells. The cytokine levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in cell culture 
      supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene 
      expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were detected by qRT-PCR. The levels of 
      protein phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK were analyzed by Western blot. 
      RESULTS: The main components in SZ-A were found to be 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), 
      1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB), fagomine (FAG), polysaccharide (APS), 
      and arginine (ARG). SZ-A reduced the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α secreted by 
      LPS-induced RAW264.7 and BMDM cells. Simultaneously, the mRNA expression levels 
      of IL-6 and TNF-α were all significantly suppressed by SZ-A in a 
      concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, SZ-A inhibited the phosphorylation 
      of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK in BMDM and the activation of ERK and JNK signaling in 
      RAW264.7 cells. We also observed that DNJ, DAB, FAG, and ARG markedly 
      downregulated IL-6 and TNF-α cytokine levels, while APS did not have an obvious 
      effect. CONCLUSIONS: SZ-A attenuates inflammation at least partly by blocking the 
      activation of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK signaling pathways. DNJ, FAG, DAB, and ARG 
      are the main constituents in SZ-A that exert anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  - As gestation proceeds the human placenta is in a constant state of renewal and 
      placental debris is released into the maternal circulation where it can trigger 
      adverse physiological and immunological responses. Trophoblast cells of the 
      placenta differentiate from mononuclear cytotrophoblast cells to fuse and form 
      the syncytiotrophoblast, a multinuclear layer that covers the entire surface of 
      the placenta. As part of this process there are significant changes to cellular 
      cytoskeletal organization and organelle morphology. In this study we have 
      examined the molecular changes that occur in mitochondria from these two cellular 
      compartments and identified differential expression of key proteins that underpin 
      changes in mitochondrial morphology, metabolism and function. Mitochondria were 
      isolated for term placental tissue and separated according to size and density by 
      sequential differential centrifugation. Isolated mitochondrial populations were 
      then subjected to proteomics using HPLC separation of peptides and MS 
      identification. Differential expression of proteins of interest was confirmed by 
      western blots. Using a bioinformatics approach we also examined published protein 
      databases to confirm our observations. In total 651 proteins were differentially 
      regulated in mitochondria from cytotrophoblast versus syncytiotrophoblast. Of 
      these 29 were statistically significant and chosen for subsequent analysis. These 
      included subunits of ATP synthase that would affect ATP production and cristae 
      structure, carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes phospoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-2, 
      pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), fatty acid 
      metabolizing enzyme acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, stress responses such a glucose 
      regulated protein-78 and protein disulfide isomerase, and mitochondrial dynamics 
      proteins mitofusin 1 and 2. Placental cell biology and mitochondrial function is 
      central to the pathogenesis of many gestational disorders such as preeclampsia, 
      pre-term birth, fetal growth restriction and gestational diabetes. These studies 
      show important shifts in mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics post trophoblast 
      differentiation and provide key molecular targets for study in pathological 
      pregnancies.

TI  - Interference of hemoglobin variants with HbA1c measurements by six commonly used 
      HbA1c methods.
PG  - 708-712
LID - 10.1093/labmed/lmae034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycated hemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serves as a crucial 
      marker for diagnosing diabetes and monitoring its progression. We aimed to assess 
      the interference posed by common Hb variants on popular HbA1c measurement 
      systems. METHODS: A total of 63 variant and nonvariant samples with target values 
      assigned by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory 
      Medicine (IFCC)-calibrated methods were included. We assessed 6 methods for 
      measuring HbA1c in the presence of HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE, and fetal hemoglobin 
      (HbF): 2 cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods 
      (Bio-Rad D-100 and HLC-723 G8), a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method (Sebia 
      Capillarys 3 TERA), an immunoassay (Roche c501), an enzyme assay system (Mindray 
      BS-600M), and a boronate affinity method (Primus Premier Hb9210). RESULTS: The 
      HbA1c results for nonvariant samples from the 6 methods were in good agreement 
      with the IFCC-calibrated method results. The Bio-Rad D-100, Capillarys 3, Mindray 
      BS-600M, Premier Hb9210, and Roche c501 showed no interference from HbS, HbC, 
      HbD, and HbE. Clinically significant interference was observed for the HLC-723 G8 
      standard mode. Elevated HbF levels caused significant negative biases for all 6 
      methods, which increased with increasing HbF concentration. CONCLUSION: Elevated 
      levels of HbF can severely affect HbA1c measurements by borate affinity, 
      immunoassays, and enzyme assays.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Phytochemicals have unique advantages in the 
      treatment of diabetes due to their multi-target activity and low toxicity. 
      Mulberry leaves, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, have been used in the 
      prevention and treatment of diabetes for centuries. The main active ingredients 
      in mulberry leaves with regards to the hypoglycemic effect are 
      1-deoxynojirimycin, flavonoids, and polysaccharides. However, the combined 
      hypoglycemic effects and mechanisms of mulberry leaf multi-components remain 
      unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study explored the anti-diabetic effects of 
      mulberry leaf multi-components (MMC) and the role of the PI-3K/Akt insulin 
      signalling pathway in improving insulin resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      main chemical components of MMC were analyzed using the phenol-sulfuric acid 
      method, aluminum nitrate-sodium nitrite method, and HPLC-ultraviolet/fluorescence 
      detection method. The T2DM rat model was created via feeding a high-fat diet and 
      peritoneal injection of streptozotocin. T2DM rats were divided into four groups: 
      model, model plus metformin, model plus low-dose, and model plus high-dose MMC 
      groups (100 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively), and plus normal group 
      for a total of five groups. MMC was administered by oral gavage for six weeks. 
      Fasting blood glucose and serum lipid profiles were measured using a glucometer 
      and an automatic biochemistry analyzer, respectively. Serum insulin and 
      adipocytokine levels were analyzed by ELISA. Hepatic glucose metabolizing enzyme 
      activity was evaluated by ELISA and the double antibody sandwich method. 
      Expression of PI-3K/Akt signalling pathway proteins was analyzed by RT-PCR and 
      Western blotting. RESULTS: Extracted 1-deoxynojirimycin, flavonoid, and 
      polysaccharide purity was 70.40%, 52.34%, and 32.60%, respectively. These 
      components were then mixed at a ratio of 1:6:8 to form MMC. MMC significantly 
      reduced serum glucose, insulin, and lipid levels. In diabetic rats, MMC enhanced 
      insulin sensitivity and alleviated inflammatory and oxidative damage by lowing 
      adipocytokine levels and increasing anti-oxidative enzyme activity. Insulin 
      resistance was also mitigated. MMC regulated the activity of key downstream 
      enzymes of hepatic glucose metabolism via activating the expression of PI-3K, 
      Akt, PDX-1, and GLUT4 at the mRNA and protein levels, thereby correcting hepatic 
      glucolipid metabolism disorders and exerting a hypoglycemic effect. CONCLUSION: 
      MMC ameliorated hepatic glucolipid metabolism disorders and improved insulin 
      resistance in T2DM rats by activating the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. These 
      results highlight the multi-component, multi-target, and combined effects of MMC, 
      and suggest it may be further developed as a hypoglycemic drug.

AB  - PURPOSE: Limited research exists on the time course of long-term retinal and 
      cerebral deficits in diabetic rodents. Previously, we examined short term (4-8 
      weeks) deficits in the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model of Type II diabetes. Here, we 
      investigated the long-term (1-8 months) temporal appearance of functional 
      deficits (retinal, cognitive, and motor), retinal vascular pathology, and retinal 
      dopamine levels in the GK rat. METHODS: In GK rats and Wistar controls, retinal 
      neuronal function (electroretinogram), cognitive function (Y-maze), and motor 
      function (rotarod) were measured at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age. In addition, 
      we evaluated retinal vascular function (functional hyperemia) and glucose and 
      insulin tolerance. Retinas from rats euthanized at ≥8 months were assessed for 
      vascular pathology. Dopamine and DOPAC levels were measured via HPLC in retinas 
      from rats euthanized at 1, 2, 8, and 12 months. RESULTS: Goto-Kakizaki rats 
      exhibited significant glucose intolerance beginning at 4 weeks and worsening over 
      time (p < 0.001). GK rats also showed significant delays in flicker and 
      oscillatory potential implicit times (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) beginning at 1 
      month. Cognitive deficits were observed beginning at 6 months (p < 0.05), but no 
      motor deficits. GK rats showed no deficits in functional hyperemia and no 
      increase in acellular retinal capillaries. Dopamine levels were twice as high in 
      GK vs. Wistar retinas at 1, 2, 8, and 12 months (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: As shown 
      previously, retinal deficits were detectable prior to cognitive deficits in GK 
      rats. While retinal neuronal function was compromised, retinal vascular pathology 
      was not observed, even at 12+ months. High endogenous levels of dopamine in the 
      GK rat may be acting as an anti-angiogenic and providing protection against 
      vascular pathology.

AB  - AIMS: We explored whether and how perilipin 2 (Plin2) protected islets against 
      lipotoxicity-induced islet dysfunction by regulating islet stellate cells (ISCs) 
      activation. METHODS: Six-week-old male rats were given a high-fat diet or a 
      control diet for 28 weeks. Glucose metabolic phenotypes were assessed using 
      glucose/insulin tolerance tests, masson, and immunohistochemical staining. ISCs 
      activation levels were assessed from rats and palmitic acid- (PA-) treated 
      cultured ISCs by immunofluorescence, Oil red O staining, electron microscopy, 
      quantitative PCR, and western blotting. Changes in ISCs phenotype of activation 
      degree and its underlying mechanisms were assessed by target gene lentiviral 
      infection, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and western blotting. 
      RESULTS: Obese rats showed glucose intolerance, decreased endocrine hormone 
      profiles, and elevated expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a polygonal 
      appearance without cytoplasmic lipid droplets of ISCs in rats and isolated 
      islets. PA-treated cultured ISCs exhibited faster proliferation and migration 
      abilities with the induction of mRNA levels of lipid metabolism proteins, 
      especially Plin2. The overexpression of Plin2 resulted in ISCs "re-quiescent" 
      phenotypes associated with inhibition of the Smad3-TGF-β signaling pathways. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest a protective role of Plin2 in weakening 
      ISCs activation. It may serve as a novel therapeutic target for preventing islet 
      fibrosis for T2DM.

TI  - Mechanism by which Huoxue Tongluo Qiwei Decoction improves the erectile function 
      of rats with diabetic erectile dysfunction.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Huoxue Tongluo Qiwei Decoction is a classical 
      herbal formula, which can improve the symptoms of erectile dysfunction (ED) 
      patients and has a good therapeutic effect on patients with diabetic erectile 
      dysfunction (DIED). The main function of Huoxue Tongluo Qiwei Decoction is to 
      stimulate the blood circulation and dredge collaterals, remove blood stasis, and 
      calm wind. RATIONALE: To further explore the mechanism of Huoxue Tongluo Qiwei 
      Decoction in the treatment of DIED, related animal experiments were designed. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical constituents of Huoxue Tongluo Qiwei 
      Decoction were identified with the help of high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A rat model was induced by 
      streptozotocin (STZ) and screened by apomorphine (APO). Serum sE-selectin, lysyl 
      oxidase-1 (LOX-1), malondialdehyde (MDA) and other markers of vascular 
      endothelial injury and related indicators of oxidative stress were studied 
      through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The endothelial cells and 
      ultrastructure of the corpus cavernosum were examined by electron microscopy and 
      HE staining. The expression of protein and mRNA was detected by western blotting 
      (WB) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: The 
      results of the study revealed that the sE-selectin, LOX-1, intercellular adhesion 
      molecule-1 (sICAM-1), endothelial microparticles (EMPs), P-selectin (CD62P), and 
      MDA levels in the serum of group M rats were considerably higher than rats of 
      group K, while the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level showed a significant 
      decrease. In addition, the PKC pathway was activated, and the expression of 
      related proteins and mRNA was increased. After 8 weeks of intervention with 
      Huoxue Tongluo Qiwei Decoction and LY333531, serum level of sE-selectin, LOX-1, 
      sICAM-1, EMPs, CD62P and MDA in L, D and G groups were remarkably lower than 
      group M while SOD level increased significantly, protein kinase C (PKC) pathway 
      was inhibited with the improved erectile function of rats. CONCLUSION: Huoxue 
      Tongluo Qiwei Decoction can inhibit the expression of protein and mRNA of the 
      PKCβ signaling pathway related molecules in DIED rats to cure the injury of 
      vascular endothelial, enhance antioxidant capacity, and prevent the activation of 
      platelet, thus improving erectile function in rats with DIED.

TI  - Diabetic Serum Inhibits Osteoblast Adhesion to Titanium Surface Through Advanced 
      Glycation End Products: An In Vitro Study.
PG  - 551-559
LID - 10.11607/jomi.8114 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus has been shown to delay osseointegration of titanium 
      dental implants. This study tested the hypothesis that serum derived from 
      diabetes negatively affects osteoblast adhesion to polystyrene and titanium 
      surfaces, partly through the presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three 
      groups: normoglycemic control, streptozotocin-induced diabetic group, and 
      diabetic group treated with the AGE inhibitor aminoguanidine. Polystyrene or 
      titanium disks were preincubated in serum derived from each group. Human 
      osteoblasts transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were cultured, and 
      the number of adherent osteoblasts was quantified. High-pressure liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) was used to fractionate eluates, which were further 
      characterized by western blot with AGE antibody and adhesion assays. In parallel, 
      sera derived from healthy patients, patients with controlled diabetes, and 
      patients with uncontrolled diabetes were utilized for osteoblast adhesion assay 
      and western blot. RESULTS: Diabetic serum significantly reduced the number of 
      adherent osteoblast and osteoblast aggregates on titanium disks, whereas 
      aminoguanidine-treated serum rescued the effect of diabetes on the number of 
      adherent osteoblast aggregates. Fractionated diabetic serum revealed distinct AGE 
      bands at ~100 kDa and 44 kDa, whereas healthy serum did not express any. In human 
      serum samples, both controlled and uncontrolled diabetes led to a significant 
      reduction in the number of adherent osteoblasts on polystyrene and titanium 
      surfaces compared with normoglycemic serum. This correlated with presence of AGEs 
      in western blot in diabetic but not in healthy serum. CONCLUSION: Osteoblast 
      adhesion on the titanium surface was greatly reduced by the exposure of serum 
      derived from diabetic rats or humans. Recovery of osteoblast aggregates by 
      aminoguanidine treatment suggests that AGEs played a role in this negative 
      effect. The correlating presence of AGEs from the fractionated sera of diabetic 
      rats or humans and impaired osteoblast adhesion on the titanium surface further 
      supports this role.

TI  - GT-11 impairs insulin signaling through modulation of sphingolipid metabolism in 
      C2C12 myotubes.

AB  - AIMS: Sphingolipids are involved in the regulation of insulin signaling, which is 
      linked to the development of insulin resistance, leading to diabetes mellitus. We 
      aimed to study whether modulation of sphingolipid levels by GT-11 may regulate 
      insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes. MAIN METHODS: We investigated the effects of 
      sphingolipid metabolism on Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake using C2C12 
      myotubes. Either GT-11, an inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase 1 and S1P 
      lyase, or siRNA targeting Sgpl1, the gene encoding the enzyme, was employed to 
      determine the effect of sphingolipid metabolism modulation on insulin signaling. 
      Western blotting and glucose uptake assays were used to evaluate the effect of 
      treatments on insulin signaling. Sphingolipid metabolites were analyzed by high 
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). KEY FINDINGS: Treatment with GT-11 
      resulted in decreased Akt phosphorylation and reduced glucose uptake. Silencing 
      the Sgpl1 gene, which encodes S1P lyase, mimicked these findings, suggesting the 
      potential for regulating insulin signaling through S1P lyase modulation. GT-11 
      modulated sphingolipid metabolism, inducing the accumulation of sphingolipids. 
      Using PF-543 and ARN14974 to inhibit sphingosine kinases and acid ceramidase, 
      respectively, we identified a significant interplay between sphingosine, S1P 
      lyase, and insulin signaling. Treatment with either exogenous sphingosine or 
      palmitic acid inhibited Akt phosphorylation, and reduced S1P lyase activity. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings highlight the importance of close relationship between 
      sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling in C2C12 myotubes, pointing to its 
      potential therapeutic relevance for diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Hemizygous deletion of CTGF/CCN2 does not suffice to prevent fibrosis of the 
      severely injured kidney.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an important mediator 
      of kidney fibrosis. Previous observations indicated that attenuation of CCN2 
      expression sufficed to alleviate early kidney damage. However, little is known 
      about the role of CCN2 in fibrosis of severely damaged and more chronically 
      injured kidneys. Therefore, we examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on 
      the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, 
      in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric 
      obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic 
      nephritis. METHODS: Wild-type (WT, CCN2(+/+)) and hemizygous CCN2(+/-) C57Bl/6 
      mice were studied. In the diabetes experiment, streptozotocin-injected and 
      control mice were followed for 6 months, with regular blood pressure, glycaemia 
      and albuminuria recordings. In the UUO experiment, the left ureter was obstructed 
      for 14 days with the contralateral kidney serving as control. For the AA 
      experiment, mice were followed for 25 days after 5 intraperitoneal injections 
      with AA and compared to control mice injected with buffer alone. Organs were 
      harvested for histology, mRNA and protein measurements. Collagen content was 
      determined by HPLC and expressed as hydroxyproline/proline ratio. RESULTS: CCN2 
      expression was significantly increased in the damaged as compared to control 
      kidneys. In all three models, CCN2 levels in the damaged kidneys of CCN2(+/-) 
      mice averaged about 50% of those in damaged WT kidneys. After 6 months of 
      diabetes, albuminuria was increased 2.5-fold in WT mice, compared to 1.5-fold in 
      CCN2(+/-) mice, mesangial matrix was expanded 5-fold in WT and 4.4-fold in 
      CCN2(+/-) mice and the glomerular basement membrane was thickened 1.3-fold in WT 
      and 1.5-fold in CCN2(+/-) mice (all differences between WT and CCN2(+/-) mice are 
      NS). Tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis scores were also not different 
      between Wt and CCN2(+/-) mice in the diabetes (1.8 vs. 1.7), UUO (2.8 vs. 2.6), 
      and AA (1.4 vs. 1.2) models, as was the case for macrophage influx and collagen 
      content in these three models. CONCLUSION: Unlike in mild and relatively early 
      STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged 
      kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. 
      This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, 
      or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring 
      further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the 
      severely injured kidney.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lespedeza species have been used as a traditional medicine to treat 
      nephritis, azotemia, inflammation, energy depletion, diabetes, and diuresis. 
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to screen the most potent Lespedeza species 
      against methylglyoxal (MGO)-induced glucotoxicity, and to elucidate the 
      mechanisms of action. Also, we will attempt to identify small chemical 
      metabolites that might be responsible for such anti-glucotoxicity effects. 
      METHODS: Firstly, the protective effect of 26 different Lespedeza species against 
      MGO-induced toxicity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was investigated. 
      The chemical metabolites of the most potent species (Lespedeza bicolor 1 (LB1) 
      were identified by high pressure liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight 
      tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS), then quantified by HPLC. The effects 
      of LB1 on MGO-induced apoptosis were measured by annexin V-FITC staining and 
      western blot. Inhibitory effects of LB1 on MGO-induced ROS generation, and effect 
      of LB1 on advanced glycation end products (AGEs) inhibitor or a glycated 
      cross-link breaker are also measured. RESULTS: Among different Lespedeza species, 
      LB1 extract was shown to reduce intracellular reactive oxidative species, exhibit 
      anti-apoptotic effects, strongly inhibit all the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      signals, inhibit MGO-induced AGEs formation, and break down preformed AGEs. We 
      tentatively identified 17 chemical constituents of LB1 by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Among 
      those, some components, such as genistein and quercetin, significantly reduced 
      the AGEs formation and increased the AGEs-breaking activity, resulting in the 
      reduction of glucotoxicity. CONCLUSION: LB1 extract has shown to be effective in 
      preventing or treating MGO-induced endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - Sugar Composition Analysis of Fuzi Polysaccharides by HPLC-MS(n) and Their 
      Protective Effects on Schwann Cells Exposed to High Glucose.
LID - 1496
AB  - Fuzi has been used to treat diabetic complications for many years in china. In a 
      previous study, we have shown that Fuzi aqueous extract can attenuate Diabetic 
      peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in rats and protect Schwann cells from injury. Thus, 
      the protective effect of Fuzi polysaccharides (FPS) on high glucose-induced SCs 
      and the preliminary mechanism were investigated. Firstly, the FPS were obtained 
      and their monose composition was analyzed by the combination of pre-column 
      derivatization and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with 
      electrospray ionization multi-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS(n)). The 
      results witnessed the efficiency of this method and seven monosaccharides were 
      tentatively identified, among which fucose was first reported. Simultaneously, 
      m/z 215 can be considered as diagnostic ions to confirm the number of 
      monosaccharides. Next, high glucose-induced SC model was applied and divided into 
      model group, treated group of FPS, normal and osmotic control group. After 
      treatment for 48 h, the data showed FPS could significantly decrease the 
      intracellular ROS and apoptosis, which were determined by the corresponding 
      fluorescent probes. Then, the expression of oxidative stress-related proteins in 
      SCs were measured by Western blot. Furthermore, the protein tests found that FPS 
      markedly up-regulated superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) protein level, 
      but down-regulated NADPH oxidase-1 (Nox1) protein level. Moreover, FPS could also 
      increase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation significantly. Hence, we 
      preliminary deduced that AMPK-PGC-1α pathway may play an important role in the 
      protective effect of FPS against high glucose-induced cell damage.

      Apoptosis in INS-1 Cells.

LID - 10.1055/s-0042-116314 [doi]
AB  - Aims: To investigate the effects of neutral ceramidase (NCDase) packaged in 
      exosomes that are secreted from β-cells on free fatty acid (FFA)-induced β-cells 
      apoptosis and its role in regulation of sphingolipid-mediated signaling pathway. 
      Methods: HPLC and Western blotting were performed to determine NCDase activity 
      and expression. Annexin V-fluorescein-isothiocyanate/propidium iodide flow 
      cytometry was used to assess apoptosis. Electrospray ionization tandem mass 
      spectrometry was used for ceramide (Cer), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and 
      sphingosine (SPH) determination. Results: INS-1 cells over-expressed NCDase 
      secreted active NCDase via exosomes. Exosomes isolated from the cultured medium 
      of INS-1 cells that oxpressed NCDase could ameliorate palmitate-induced 
      apoptosis. Furthermore, the results showed that exosome-derived NCDase treatment 
      reduced intracellular Cer/S1P ratio. Conclusions: β-cell secreted active NCDase 
      via exosome, the exosome-packaged-NCDase protected β-cells from FFA-induced 
      apoptosis through regulating sphingolipid metabolites and it might be a potential 
      treatment for β-cell lipotoxicity and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the anti-diabetic and 
      anti-hyperlipidemic effects and relative mechanisms of guava polysaccharides 
      (GPs) in rats with type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM). The chemical characterization 
      and monosaccharide compositions of GPs, named as GP-1, GP-2, GP-3, and GP-4, were 
      determined by PMP-HPLC and FT-IR. The results revealed that all GPs had the 
      typical saccharide absorptions, and all were heteropolysaccharides. In addition, 
      GPs efficiently decreased levels of fasting blood glucose, glucosylated serum 
      protein, serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, total 
      cholesterol, triglyceride and serum alanine transaminase, improved oral glucose 
      tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity in rats with T2DM. Histopathological 
      observations suggested that GP-1, GP-3, and GP-4 could alleviate injury in 
      pancreatic islet cells, and Western blot analysis showed that these GPs 
      upregulated gene expression of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 
      2, Akt, and glucose transporter type 4. Taken together, these data suggest that 
      GPs may be beneficial in treating T2DM and reducing the risk of hyperlipidemia, 
      vascular disease, and cirrhosis via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

PG  - 41-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.052 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Jinqi formula is a traditional Chinese 
      anti-diabetic formula containing three ingredients (Coptidis rhizoma, Astragali 
      rhadix and Lonicerae japonicae Flos). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active fractions 
      of Jinqi formula were purified and HPLC analyses were used for quality control. 
      The anti-adipogenic effects of Jinqi formula were analyzed in vitro using 3T3-L1 
      cells and in vivo with KK-A(y) mice. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to confirm 
      genes and proteins of interest, respectively. RESULTS: In vitro study showed that 
      Jinqi formula suppressed the accumulation of triglyceride (TG) and free fatty 
      acids (FFA) in mature 3T3-L1 cells by increasing the expression and tyrosine 
      phosphorylation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), as well as decreasing 
      the expression of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC), Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) and 
      Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL). In vivo study demonstrated that Jinqi formula 
      reduced body weight without changing food intake in KK-A(y) mice, and decreased 
      the levels of serum glucose, TG, FFA. In addition, consistent with the in vitro 
      study results, Jinqi formula increased the expression and tyrosine 
      phosphorylation of AMPK in the liver and muscular tissues of the KK-A(y) mice. 
      Furthermore, Jingqi formula suppressed the expression of ACC and HSL and 
      upregulated the expression of IRS-1 in the liver. Whereas in the skeletal 
      muscles, Jingqi formula decreased the expression of ACC and increased the 
      expression of GLUT-4 and IRS-2. CONCLUSIONS: Jingqi formula inhibits TG 
      accumulation at least in part via the stimulation of AMPK activity in a 
      multi-target manner.

      scientific name Scolopendridae; Chilopoda; Scolopendridae) are traditional 
      Chinese medicines, and they belong to the family entomology. A combination of 
      leech and centipede is used as an effective medicine to promote blood circulation 
      and remove blood stasis in traditional Chinese medicine, and "leech-centipede" 
      medicine has been used in many prescriptions to treat diabetic vascular disease, 
      including diabetic erectile dysfunction (DIED). However, its specific mechanism 
      remains unclear and requires in-depth study. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed 
      to investigate the mechanism of "leech-centipede" medicine to improve erectile 
      dysfunction-associated diabetes by detecting PKC pathway-related molecules. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active ingredients of "leech-centipede" medicine were 
      identified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fifty male SPF 
      rats were injected with streptozotocin to induce the DM model. Eight weeks later, 
      the DMED model was validated with apomorphine. The DIED rats were divided into 
      five groups-T,P,DD,DZ, and DG-and were separately treated with tadalafil, pathway 
      inhibitor LY333531 and low-, medium-, and high-dose "leech-centipede" medicine 
      for 8 weeks. After treatment, the blood glucose level was measured, erectile 
      function with apomorphine was assessed, the LOX-1, sE-selectin, sICAM-1, SOD, and 
      MDA in serum was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow 
      cytometry was performed. After the collection of penile tissue, the related 
      protein and mRNA expression was assessed by Western blotting and PCR, and the 
      tissue and ultrastructure were analysed by HE staining, immunohistochemistry and 
      scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: After treatment, the erectile function of 
      rats was significantly improved in the T,P,DD,DZ, and DG groups compared with 
      that in the model group. Thus, "leech-centipede" medicine can significantly 
      reduce the levels of LOX-1, sE-selectin, sICAM-1, EMPs and CD62P to protect 
      vascular endothelial function and anti-platelet activation, improving DIED rat 
      erectile function. Additionally, "leech-centipede" medicine can increase SOD 
      expression and decrease MDA expression, reducing the possibility of oxidative 
      stress injury in DIED rats and improving the antioxidant capacity. Moreover, 
      "leech-centipede" therapy can dramatically reduce the protein and mRNA expression 
      of DAG, PKCβ, NF-κB, and ICAM-1, improve vascular endothelial injury in DIED rats 
      and inhibit abnormal platelet activation. CONCLUSION: "leech-centipede" medicine 
      can improve erectile dysfunction by inhibiting the expression of PKC 
      pathway-related molecules in DIED rats and protects endothelial function and 
      anti-platelet activation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Polygonatum kingianum is a traditional Chinese medicine commonly used 
      to treat diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Polysaccharides from Polygonatum kingianum 
      could regulate glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD) rats. METHODS: 
      The gel permeation chromatography (GPC), liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
      chemical analysis were used to determine the molecular weight, monosaccharide 
      composition, protein, polysaccharide and uronic acid content of the 
      polysaccharide from Polygonatum kingianum, respectively. Total (PS) and high 
      molecular weight (PSF) polysaccharides (> 100 KDa) were isolated and treated HFD 
      rats for a 14-week period. TC, TG contents in blood samples were measured every 
      two weeks, and HDL-C, LDL-C was measured at 12 and 14 weeks evaluating of blood 
      lipids regulation activity of polysaccharide. The stool samples were used for 16S 
      rDNA V4 highly variable region measurement method to regulate the role of 
      polysaccharide in the intestinal microflora. The content of short chain fatty 
      acid (SCFAs) in faeces was determined by gas chromatography (GC) to investigate 
      the effect of polysaccharides on the content of SCFAs in the intestinal tract of 
      rats. The expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 and occludin of intestinal 
      tissue, and detection of the key protein expression in the LPS-TLR4/NFκB 
      signaling pathway were detected by Western blot technique. RESULTS: We found that 
      PS and PSF improved both diabetic symptoms and lipid metabolism. PS and PSF also 
      modulated the gut microbiota composition, abundance and diversity of HFD rats, 
      increased the relative abundance of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing 
      bacteria and increased SCFA production, reduced intestinal permeability, relieved 
      gastrointestinal inflammation, and improved lipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: 
      Polygonatum kingianum polysaccharides regulated the abundance and diversity of 
      the intestinal microbial community through increasing the relative abundance of 
      SCFA-producing bacteria. This promotes recovery of the intestinal permeability 
      barrier, inhibits LPS entry into the circulation, alleviates inflammation, and 
      prevents glucose and lipid metabolic disorders.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the protective effect of intravitreal injection of exendin-4 
      analogue (E4a) in early diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to explore its possible 
      mechanism. METHODS: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: 
      normal (N), diabetic (D), and E4a-treated diabetic rats (E4a). Diabetes was 
      induced by streptozotocin. Rats in the E4a group were treated with E4a (0.1 
      μg/2μL/eye), whereas the N and D groups were treated with the equivalent volume 
      of normal saline. Electroretinography was performed at 1 month and 3 months after 
      diabetes onset. Thicknesses and cell counts in each layer of the retina were 
      evaluated. The concentration of glutamate was measured by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC). Expressions of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) 
      and GLAST (excitatory amino acid transporter) were detected at mRNA and protein 
      levels and verified by immunohistochemistry in vitro and in vivo. The rMc-1 cells 
      were cultured under high-glucose medium (25 mM), which mimicked diabetic 
      conditions. Effects of E4a (10 μg/mL) were also tested in the rMc-1 culture 
      system. RESULTS: E4a prevented the reduction in b-wave amplitude and oscillatory 
      potential amplitude caused by diabetes. It also prevented the cell loss of outer 
      nuclear layer and inner nuclear layer; the thickness and cell count in the outer 
      nuclear layer were decreased in 1-month diabetic rats. The concentration of 
      glutamate in the retina was higher in diabetic rats and was significantly reduced 
      in the E4a-treated group. Consistent with such changes, retinal GLP-1R and GLAST 
      expression were reduced in the diabetic retina but upregulated in E4a-treated 
      rats. No improvement was found in the retina in both functional and morphologic 
      parameters 3 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal administration of 
      E4a can prevent the retina, functionally and morphologically, from the insults of 
      diabetes in rats. GLP-1R and GLAST were proved to exist in the rat retina, and 
      their lowered expressions in the diabetic retina might be related to retinal 
      damage by increasing the retinal glutamate. E4a might protect the retina by 
      reducing the glutamate level through upregulating GLP-1R and GLAST, as observed 
      in retinal Müller cells in this study, but this protective effect was transient. 
      Thus, this could be a potential approach for the treatment of DR.

AB  - Diabetic vascular complications are associated with endothelial dysfunction. 
      Various plant-derived polyphenols benefit cardiovascular function by protecting 
      endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production through as yet unclear mechanisms. This 
      study compared the effects of two structurally similar polyphenols, Morin (MO) 
      and Quercetin (QU), on endothelial function in isolated aorta from control and 
      streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Vascular function under treatment 
      with MO, QU, and various signaling pathway modulators was measured by isometric 
      tension in an organ bath system, NO production by chemical assay and HPLC, and 
      changes in protein signaling factor expression or activity by western blotting 
      (WB). Both polyphenols acted as potent vasodilators and this effect was 
      associated with increased phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial NO synthase 
      (eNOS). An Akt inhibitor blocked MO- and QU-induced vasorelaxation as well as Akt 
      phosphorylation. However, inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and 
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppressed only QU-induced vasorelaxation, NO 
      production, and AMPK phosphorylation. These results suggested that plant 
      polyphenols MO and QU both promote eNOS-mediated NO production and vasodilation 
      in diabetic aorta, MO via Akt pathway activation and QU via PI3K/Akt and AMPK 
      pathway activation. Elucidation of these pathways may define effective 
      therapeutic targets for diabetic vascular dysfunction.

AB  - We describe a simplified approach for the purification and characterization of 
      urinary albumin, a key biomarker currently used for understanding the onset and 
      prognosis of microalbuminuria. Urinary albumin was purified from human urine 
      collected from diabetic kidney disease patients by using 2-stage tangential flow 
      filtration process and set of column chromatography steps. The relative molecular 
      mass of urinary albumin is 66,871 Da (SYNAPT G2 High Definition Mass Spectrometry 
      System). Isolated urinary albumin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, 
      immunoelectrophoresis, Ouchterlony double-immunodiffusion, single radial 
      immunodiffusion, size-exclusion HPLC and peptide mass fingerprint analysis. The 
      size-exclusion HPLC elution profile of the purified urinary albumin was similar 
      to that of a reference form of native albumin. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis 
      of the purified urinary albumin yielded peptides that partially matched with 
      known sequence of ALBU_HUMAN (P02768). This is the first report of purification 
      and validation of immunochemically reactive form of urinary albumin from a large 
      volume of urine of diabetic kidney disease patients. In this purification 
      approach, the cost of the purified albumin is significantly lower.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to identify the proteomic differences 
      between the aqueous humour of diabetes patients with cataracts and that of 
      non-diabetic sufferers of cataracts in a clinical setting. METHODS: Patients were 
      divided into the diabetic experimental group and the non-diabetic control group. 
      Aqueous humour specimens were obtained via cataract surgery. Sample proteins were 
      treated with a TMT reagent, separated using a cation chromatography column, and 
      analysed using a C18 desalting column. Proteins were identified using HPLC-MS/MS. 
      The differential proteins were identified using both a p value of < 0.05 and a 
      fold change of > 1.2. GO classification enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway 
      enrichment analysis, protein interaction network analysis, and ingenuity pathway 
      analysis were all carried out. The expression level of four differential proteins 
      were verified by Western blot, and GC and TTR expressions were further examined 
      using an expanded sample pool. RESULTS: The postprandial glucose levels between 
      the experimental group (9.40 ± 1.35 mmol/L) and the control group (6.56 ± 0.81 
      mmol/L) were significantly different, with a p value of 1.16E-06. It is important 
      to note, however, that the baseline levels of the parameters showed no 
      statistical differences. In total, 397 aqueous humour proteins were identified; 
      of these, 137 showed significant differences, with 63 upregulated ones and 74 
      down-regulated ones. The differential proteins play important roles in numerous 
      biological processes and pathways, such as complement and coagulation cascades 
      (p = 1.71E-09). Some of these differential proteins are associated with diabetic 
      retinal degeneration and other diabetic complications. Differential proteins, 
      such as HP, GC, and TTR, have high node degree in the protein interaction 
      network. Western blot results further confirmed that GC were down-regulated while 
      TTR was up-regulated in aqueous humour under diabetic condition. CONCLUSION: A 
      list of differential proteins in the human aqueous humour of diabetic patients 
      was established. Proteins with high interaction scores as per protein interaction 
      analysis, such as GC and TTR, were further verified and could potentially be used 
      as early diagnostic markers for diabetic eye complications in clinical practice.

TI  - Tissue cholesterol content alterations in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
PG  - 909-17
LID - 10.1038/aps.2012.50 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Diabetes is associated with elevated serum total cholesterol level and 
      disrupted lipoprotein subfractions. The aim of this study was to examine 
      alterations in the tissue cholesterol contents closely related to diabetic 
      complications. METHODS: Intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin was used to 
      induce type 1 diabetes in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. On d 35 after the 
      injection, liver, heart, intestine, kidney, pancreas, cerebral cortex and 
      hippocampus were isolated from the rats. The content of total and free 
      cholesterol in the tissues was determined using HPLC. The ATP-binding cassette 
      protein A1 (ABCA1) protein and ApoE mRNA were measured using Western blot and 
      QT-PCR analyses, respectively. RESULTS: In diabetic rats, the level of free 
      cholesterol was significantly decreased in the peripheral tissues, but 
      significantly elevated in hippocampus, as compared with those in the control 
      rats. Diabetic rats showed a trend of decreasing the total cholesterol level in 
      the peripheral tissues, but significant change was only found in kidney and 
      liver. In diabetic rats, the level of the ABCA1 protein was significantly 
      increased in the peripheral tissues and cerebral cortex; the expression of ApoE 
      mRNA was slightly decreased in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, but the change 
      had no statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Type 1 diabetes decreases the free 
      cholesterol content in the peripheral tissues and increases the free cholesterol 
      content in hippocampus. The decreased free cholesterol level in the peripheral 
      tissues may be partly due to the increased expression of the ABCA1 protein.

TI  - High mobility group box 1 is a novel substrate of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV.
PG  - 236-44
LID - 10.1007/s00125-011-2213-6 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a cytokine with a key role 
      in tissue regeneration and angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that topical 
      application of HMGB1 to skin wounds of mouse models of diabetes enhanced vessel 
      density and accelerated wound healing, suggesting that diabetes may affect 
      endogenous HMGB1 functions. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV/CD26) is a protease 
      whose activity is increased in diabetes and whose inhibition improves glucose 
      tolerance. Since HMGB1 contains potential DPP-IV cleavage sites, we determined 
      whether HMGB1 may be a substrate for DPP-IV and whether DPP-IV-mediated cleavage 
      may alter the biological activity of HMGB1. METHODS: Reversed phase HPLC, mass 
      spectrometry and western blot analyses were performed to analyse and identify 
      HMGB1 peptides generated following DPP-IV digestion. HMGB1 angiogenic functions 
      in the presence of DPP-IV were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. HMGB1 protein was 
      detected in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients before and after treatment with 
      DPP-IV inhibitors. RESULTS: DPP-IV cleaved HMGB1 at its N-terminal region and 
      affected its angiogenic functions. Specifically, DPP-IV inhibited HMGB1-induced 
      endothelial cell migration and capillary-like structure formation, as well as 
      HMGB1-mediated vascular network formation in Matrigel implants in mice. We had 
      previously found that HMGB1 promoted endothelial cell migration through 
      activation of extracellular regulated kinase signalling pathway. Here we showed 
      that such an effect was abolished in the presence of DPP-IV. Finally, the 
      N-terminal truncated form of HMGB1 was detected in the serum of type 2 diabetic 
      patients, in whom DPP-IV inhibitors enhanced the levels of full-length HMGB1. 
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: DPP-IV cleaves HMGB1 and, via this mechanism, 
      inhibits HMGB1 angiogenic activity. Treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors may enhance 
      HMGB1 activity in diabetic patients, thereby improving angiogenesis in this 
      condition.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of recombinant 
      polypeptide-p derived from Momordica charantia on diabetic rats. In this 
      research, the optimized sequence of polypeptide-p gene fused to a secretion 
      signal tag was cloned into the expression vector and transformed into probiotic 
      Saccharomyces boulardii. The production of recombinant secretion protein was 
      verified by western blotting, HPLC, and mass spectrometry. To assay recombinant 
      yeast bioactivity in the gut, diabetic rats were orally fed wild-type and 
      recombinant S. boulardii, in short SB and rSB, respectively, at two low and high 
      doses as well as glibenclamide as a reference drug. In untreated diabetic and 
      treated diabetic + SB rats (low and high doses), the blood glucose increased from 
      461, 481, and 455 (mg/dl), respectively, to higher than 600 mg/dl on the 21st 
      day. Whereas glibenclamide and rSB treatments showed a significant reduction in 
      the blood glucose level. The result of this study promised a safe plant-source 
      supplement for diabetes through probiotic orchestration.

AB  - Glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MGO) are two important biomarkers in diabetes. 
      Analytical methods for determination of GO and MGO in serum samples are either 
      HPLC with UV-Vis (low sensitivity) or MS/MS (expensive) detection. These 
      disadvantages have hampered the introduction of these biomarkers as a routine 
      analyte for diabetes diagnostics into the clinical laboratory. In this study, we 
      introduce a UHPLC method with fluorescence detection for the measurement of GO 
      and MGO in serum samples by pre-column derivatization at neutral pH with 5, 
      6-diamino-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine sulfate (DDP) to form lumazines. The method was 
      validated as per FDA guidelines. Using this method, we have determined GO and MGO 
      in a variety of animal serum samples, and for example, determined the GO and MGO 
      concentration in adult bovine serum to be 852 ± 27 and 192 ± 10 nmol/L, 
      respectively. In human serum, GO and MGO levels in non-diabetic subjects (n = 14) 
      were determined to be 154 ± 88 and 98 ± 27 nmol/L, and in serum samples from 
      subjects with diabetes (n = 14) 244 ± 137 and 190 ± 68 nmol/L, respectively. In 
      addition, interference studies showed that physiological serum components did not 
      lead to an artificial increase in the levels of GO and MGO.

TI  - Topical administration of DPP-IV inhibitors prevents retinal neurodegeneration in 
      experimental diabetes.
PG  - 2285-2298
LID - 10.1007/s00125-017-4388-y [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The main aims of the present study were: (1) to assess the 
      expression and content of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) in human and db/db 
      mouse retinas, and in human vitreous fluid; and (2) to determine whether the 
      topical administration of the DPP-IV inhibitors (DPP-IVi) would prevent retinal 
      neurodegeneration and vascular leakage in db/db mice by reducing endogenous 
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) degradation. METHODS: To assess the expression 
      and content of DPP-IV, human samples of vitreous fluid and retinas were obtained 
      from participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 8) and age-matched non-diabetic 
      individuals (n = 8), as well as from db/db (n = 72) and db/+ (n = 28) mice. The 
      interventional study, which included 72 db/db mice, consisted of the topical 
      administration (eye drops) of saxagliptin, sitagliptin or vehicle for 14 days. 
      DPP-IV mRNA levels were assessed by RT-PCR, and protein content was measured by 
      ELISA or western blotting. GLP-1 was assessed by immunofluorescence, and its 
      downstream effector exchange protein activated by cAMP-1 (EPAC-1) was used as a 
      measure of GLP-1 receptor activation. Retinal analyses were performed in vivo by 
      electroretinography and ex vivo by RT-PCR (Epac-1, Iba-1 [also known as Aif1]), 
      western blotting (EPAC-1, glial fibrillar acidic protein [GFAP], 
      glutamate-aspartate transporter [GLAST]) and immunofluorescence measurements 
      (GLP-1, GFAP, ionised calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 [IBA-1], TUNEL, GLAST, 
      albumin and collagen IV). Glutamate was quantified by HPLC. In addition, vascular 
      leakage was examined by the Evans Blue method. RESULTS: DPP-IV was present in 
      human vitreous fluid but in a range 100-fold less than in plasma. Both mRNA 
      levels and protein content were much lower in the retina than in the liver or 
      bowel, but were significantly higher in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from 
      diabetic donors in comparison to non-diabetic donors (p < 0.05). Topical 
      treatment with DPP-IVi prevented glial activation, apoptosis and vascular leakage 
      induced by diabetes in db/db mice (p < 0.05). Moreover, it also significantly 
      prevented diabetes-induced functional abnormalities in the electroretinogram. A 
      significant increase of both GLP-1 and EPAC-1 was found after treatment with 
      DPP-IVi (p < 0.05). Furthermore, GLAST downregulation induced by diabetes was 
      prevented, resulting in a significant reduction of extracellular glutamate 
      concentrations. All these effects were observed without any changes in blood 
      glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The topical administration of DPP-IVi 
      is effective in preventing neurodegeneration and vascular leakage in the diabetic 
      retina. These effects can be attributed to an enhancement of GLP-1, but other 
      mechanisms unrelated to the prevention of GLP-1 degradation cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Endogenous glutamine decrease is associated with pancreatic cancer progression.
PG  - 95361-95376
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.20545 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is becoming the second leading cause of 
      cancer-related death in the Western world. The mortality is very high, which 
      emphasizes the need to identify biomarkers for early detection. As glutamine 
      metabolism alteration is a feature of PDAC, its in vivo evaluation may provide a 
      useful tool for biomarker identification. Our aim was to identify a handy method 
      to evaluate blood glutamine consumption in mouse models of PDAC. We quantified 
      the in vitro glutamine uptake by Mass Spectrometry (MS) in tumor cell 
      supernatants and showed that it was higher in PDAC compared to non-PDAC tumor and 
      pancreatic control human cells. The increased glutamine uptake was paralleled by 
      higher activity of most glutamine pathway-related enzymes supporting nucleotide 
      and ATP production. Free glutamine blood levels were evaluated in orthotopic and 
      spontaneous mouse models of PDAC and other pancreatic-related disorders by 
      High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and/or MS. Notably we observed a 
      reduction of blood glutamine as much as the tumor progressed from pancreatic 
      intraepithelial lesions to invasive PDAC, but was not related to chronic 
      pancreatitis-associated inflammation or diabetes. In parallel the increased 
      levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) were observed. By contrast blood 
      glutamine levels were stable in non-tumor bearing mice. These findings 
      demonstrated that glutamine uptake is measurable both in vitro and in vivo. The 
      higher in vitro avidity of PDAC cells corresponded to a lower blood glutamine 
      level as soon as the tumor mass grew. The reduction in circulating glutamine 
      represents a novel tool exploitable to implement other diagnostic or prognostic 
      PDAC biomarkers.

      complement but now known to modulate adaptive T cell responses. It is expressed 
      on all cell types. We investigated whether nonenzymatic glycation could impair 
      its function and potentially be relevant to complications of diabetes mellitus 
      and other conditions that result in nonenzymatic glycation including cancer, 
      Alzheimer's disease, and aging. Immunoblots of affinity-purified DAF from 
      erythrocytes of patients with diabetes showed pentosidine, glyoxal-AGEs, 
      carboxymethyllysine, and argpyrimidine. HPLC/MS analyses of glucose modified DAF 
      localized the sites of AGE modifications to K(125) adjacent to K(126), K(127) at 
      the junction of CCPs2-3 and spatially near R(96), and R(100), all identified as 
      being critical for DAF's function. Functional analyses of glucose or ribose 
      treated DAF protein showed profound loss of its regulatory activity. The data 
      argue that de-regulated activation of systemic complement and de-regulated 
      activation of T cells and leukocytes could result from non-enzymatic glycation of 
      DAF.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Si Wei Jiang Huang Tang San (SWJHTS) is a 
      traditional Tibetan medicine prescription for the treatment of urethritis, 
      frequent urination, and urgency, composed of four traditional Chinese medicines: 
      Curcumae longae rhizoma, Berberidis cortex, Tribuli fructus, and Phyllanthi 
      fructus. However, whether SWJHTS exhibits hypoglycemic efficacy and its specific 
      mechanism remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we aimed to 
      investigate the anti-diabetic effects of SWJHTS and elucidate the underlying 
      mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPLC-MS method was used to identify the key 
      components of four kinds of traditional Chinese medicine (Curcumae longae 
      rhizoma, Berberidis cortex., Tribuli fructus, and Phyllanthi fructus) which 
      composed SWJHTS and determine their structure. Normal mice and 145 mg/kg 
      STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice were treated with three doses of SWJTHS by oral 
      gavage. Body weight, 24h food and water intake, fasting blood glucose, glucose 
      tolerance and other indicators were measured to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect 
      of SWJHTS. OMIM, Genecards and other databases were used to collect targets of 
      diabetes, and HPLC-MS results and TCMSP database information were used to collect 
      drug component targets. Bioinformatics methods such as pathway enrichment 
      analysis and molecular docking were used to predict the key targets of SWJHTS. 
      The gene and protein expressions of HIF1α and ERK signaling pathways in HepG2 
      cells treated with SWJHTS were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: A 
      total of 181 components were identified, including curcumin, palmatine, and 
      berberine, etc. The in vivo studies showed that SWJHTS could significantly lower 
      fasting blood glucose levels and improve the symptoms of polydipsia, polyphagia, 
      and polyuria in diabetic mice. Furthermore, we identified HIF1α as the potential 
      key target of SWJHTS against diabetes utilizing network pharmacology approach and 
      in silico molecular docking. Subsequently, we experimentally confirmed that 
      SWJHTS could suppress the high glucose-induced upregulation of HIF1α expression, 
      which mediated the glucose consumption in HepG2 cells. The ERK signaling pathway 
      was further found to be activated by the SWJHTS as the upstream of HIF1α. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SWJHTS can improve glucose metabolism by targeting the ERK/HIF1α 
      signaling pathway; hence might be a prospective anti-diabetic drug for diabetic 
      patients as traditional Tibetan medicine.

TI  - Amelioration of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using Rapeseed (Brassica napus)-Derived 
      Peptides through Stimulating Calcium-Sensing Receptor: Effects on Glucagon-Like 
      Peptide-1 Secretion and Hepatic Lipid Metabolism.
PG  - 23804-23818
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.4c03987 [doi]
AB  - The potential of rapeseed-derived peptides (RDPs) in the amelioration of type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been hypothesized. However, the mechanisms of the 
      intestinal endocrine hormones activated by RDPs have not been fully understood. 
      This study aimed to explore the amelioration of T2DM and associated hepatic lipid 
      metabolism disorders using RDPs by affecting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
      secretion. Eight RDPs were prepared by different stepwise enzymatic hydrolysis, 
      wherein RCPP-3 (sequential using alcalase/flavourzyme) and RNPP-1 (sequential 
      using alcalase/trypsin) maintained the normal blood glucose level, significantly 
      increased the body weight (27.17 ± 0.19%) in T2DM mice compared to the positive 
      group (p < 0.05). Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments indicated 
      that RCPP-3 and RNPP-1 regulated the intestinal endocrine hormones GLP-1 
      secretion through the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Additionally, the PI3K-Akt 
      pathway was significantly activated by GLP-1, leading to marked improvements in 
      hepatic lipid parameters (TC, TG, LDL-c, and HDL-c) and mitigated fat 
      accumulation (p < 0.05). Notably, the stimulating effect of RCPP-3 on GLP-1 was 
      10.05% ± 0.71% higher than RNPP-1. G2-R3, a fraction separated from RCPP-3, which 
      contained 14 peptides with the best capacity to stimulate GLP-1 secretion, was 
      identified using HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. This study suggests the potential of RDPs as 
      novel functional food supplements for ameliorating T2DM.

TI  - Attenuation of methylglyoxal-induced glycation and cellular dysfunction in wound 
      healing by Centella cordifolia.
PG  - 813-824
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.11.016 [doi]
AB  - Current pre-clinical evidences of Centella focus on its pharmacological effects 
      on normal wound healing but there are limited studies on the bioactivity of 
      Centella in cellular dysfunction associated with diabetic wounds. Hence we 
      planned to examine the potential of Centella cordifolia in inhibiting 
      methylglyoxal (MGO)-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) glycation and promoting 
      the related cellular functions. A Cell-ECM adhesion assay examined the ECM 
      glycation induced by MGO. Different cell types that contribute to the healing 
      process (fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells) were evaluated for 
      their ability to adhere to the glycated ECM. Methanolic extract of Centella 
      species was prepared and partitioned to yield different solvent fractions which 
      were further analysed by high performance liquid chromatography equipped with 
      photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) method. Based on the antioxidant 
      [2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay] screening, anti-glycation activity 
      and total phenolic content (TPC) of the different Centella species and fractions, 
      the ethyl acetate fraction of C. cordifolia was selected for further 
      investigating its ability to inhibit MGO-induced ECM glycation and promote 
      cellular distribution and adhesion. Out of the three Centella species (C. 
      asiatica, C. cordifolia and C. erecta), the methanolic extract of C. cordifolia 
      showed maximum inhibition of Advanced glycation end products (AGE) fluorescence 
      (20.20 ± 4.69 %, 25.00 ± 3.58 % and 16.18 ± 1.40 %, respectively). Its ethyl 
      acetate fraction was enriched with phenolic compounds (3.91 ± 0.12 mg CAE/μg 
      fraction) and showed strong antioxidant (59.95 ± 7.18 μM TE/μg fraction) and 
      antiglycation activities. Improvement of cells spreading and adhesion of 
      endothelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes was observed for ethyl acetate 
      treated MGO-glycated extracellular matrix. Significant reduction in attachment 
      capacity of EA.hy926 cells seeded on MGO-glycated fibronectin (41.2%) and 
      attachment reduction of NIH3t3 and HaCaT cells seeded on MGO-glycated collagen 
      (33.7% and 24.1%, respectively) were observed. Our findings demonstrate that 
      ethyl acetate fraction of C. cordifolia was effective in attenuating MGO-induced 
      glycation and cellular dysfunction in the in-vitro wound healing models 
      suggesting that C. cordifolia could be a potential candidate for diabetic wound 
      healing. It could be subjected for further isolation of new phytoconstituents 
      having potential diabetic wound healing properties.

TI  - Presence of pyrroloquinazoline alkaloid in Adhatoda vasica attenuates 
      inflammatory response through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators in 
      LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.

AB  - Introduction: Inflammation is the primary response caused due to harmful stimuli 
      which are followed by the increased draining of plasma and immune cells from the 
      body into the site of the injured tissue. A signaling cascade of growth factors 
      and cytokines propagates and eventually matures in the inflammatory site 
      involving the blood vessels and immune markers within the injured tissue in order 
      to promote the renewal of the degenerated tissue. During a chronic disorder like 
      diabetic foot ulcer, there is an obstinate inflammation which may act as a prime 
      factor for limb amputation and upon persistent prevalence may even lead to death. 
      Methods: This study focuses on the mode of action of ALK-F (alkaloid fraction) 
      isolated from Adhatoda vasica in attenuating the nitric oxide production which 
      was estimated by Griess assay, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 
      (IL-6) expression was analyzed by ELISA and expression of COX-2 and iNOS by 
      RT-PCR and western blotting in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Total 
      intracellular ROS was analyzed by DCFH-DA probing and the presence of quinazoline 
      alkaloid (vasicine) in the ALK-F was evidenced by high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC). Results: The ALK-F of A. vasica exhibited a significant 
      inhibitory effect on LPS elicited nitrite production (13.2 ± 1.06 µM), iNOS, and 
      COX-2 (2.6 and 3.3 fold) in a dose-dependent manner. There was a significant 
      decrease in the generation of these pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α (1102 ± 1.02 
      pg/mL) and IL-6 (18 ± 0.87 ng/mL) and total intracellular ROS in the highest 
      tested concentrations (1 µg and 10 µg) of ALK-F of A. vasica. HPLC analysis by 
      the gradient elution method revealed the presence of 12% of quinazoline alkaloid 
      vasicine in the crude alkaloid fraction. Conclusion: Thus this study communally 
      suggests that attenuation of nitric oxide and the dysregulation of genes 
      responsible for inflammation which deliberates A. vasica to conflict against 
      inflammation and provide remedial benefits in diabetic wound care.

      multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 and organic cation transporter 2 in rats.

AB  - Among the endocrine and metabolic disorders, type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common progressive diseases related to 
      aging. Metformin and tamsulosin as the first-choice drug for patients with T2DM 
      and BPH, respectively, are often co-administered to male patients with T2DM and 
      BPH. However, whether concomitantly administering metformin and tamsulosin leads 
      to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate 
      the effect of tamsulosin on the pharmacokinetics of metformin and explore the 
      relevant underlying mechanism. The plasma, urine, and tissue concentrations of 
      metformin were analyzed using HPLC, and metformin cell uptake was analyzed using 
      LC-MS/MS. In addition, western blotting was used to investigate the expression of 
      Oct1, Oct2, and Mate1. As demonstrated by comparison with metformin alone, 
      tamsulosin significantly increased the area under concentration-time curves 
      (AUC(0-t)), the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and the decreased 24 h 
      cumulative urinary excretion of metformin after single or multiple-dose 
      administration in rats, as well as increased the kidney tissue concentration of 
      metformin after multiple-dose. In addition, tamsulosin treatment significantly 
      inhibited the expression of Mate1 and Oct2 in rat kidneys, but Oct1 and Mate1 did 
      not show a significant difference in the liver. Consistently, tamsulosin 
      inhibited OCT2 and MATE1 expressions and decreased metformin uptake in HEK293 
      cells. Notably, serum LCA level in the co-administration group was increased by 
      34% and 39% after multiple-dose (7 and 14 consecutive days, respectively) 
      administration compared to the metformin alone group. Altogether, our data 
      suggest that tamsulosin could increase systemic exposure and reduce excretion of 
      metformin via inhibiting Oct2 and Mate1-mediated transport cooperatively.

AB  - The phenolic compound, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzoic acid (HMBA), is one of the 
      major phytoconstituents of Decalepis arayalpathra (Joseph & Chandra.) Venter, a 
      rare and endemic medicinal plant found in the Western Ghats of India. HMBA has 
      been attributed to possess several biological effects including 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic. The present 
      article describes a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometric method (HPLC-MS/MS) for the determination of HMBA in rat plasma. In 
      brief, the developed assay involves pre-treatment of the plasma samples by an 
      optimized solid phase extraction method (recoveries for HMBA greater than 90%) 
      followed by chromatographic separation on a Cosmosil C18 (150mm×4.6mm i.d.; 5μm 
      particle size) analytical column with mobile phase of methanol and 10mM ammonium 
      formate (95:5 v/v; 0.2% formic acid) delivered at a constant flow rate of 
      1.0mL/min. The detection and quantification was performed using an Applied 
      Biosystems Hybrid Q-Trap API 2000 mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray 
      ionization source (ESI) functioning in negative mode. The developed assay was 
      validated as per the US FDA bioanalytical guidelines with the calibration curve 
      linear over the concentration range of 5.05-2019.60ng/mL (r(2)≥0.9936) for HMBA 
      from rat plasma. Further, the validated HPLC-MS/MS method was successfully 
      applied to pharmacokinetic study of HMBA after oral administration of D. 
      arayalpathra tuber extracts to female albino Wistar rats using sparse sampling 
      methodology. Following oral administration, the maximum mean concentration in rat 
      plasma (Cmax -1301.57±128.22ng/mL) was achieved at 1.5h (Tmax) and the area under 
      the curve (AUC0-48h) was 8985.02±229.54ngh/mL. The elimination half-life (t1/2) 
      and terminal elimination rate constant (Kel) were 2.48h and 0.28 L/h, 
      respectively.

PG  - e13623

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a major complication in patients with diabetes. Herein, 
      we investigate how hawthorn polyphenol extract (HPE) affects high glucose-induced 
      oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis in ARPE-19 cells. HPLC-MS/MS was used to 
      determine HPE content and composition. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 
      was assessed using fluorescence microscopy, while glucose-induced gene and 
      protein expressions were analyzed using real-time PCR and western blotting in 
      cells transfected with miR-34a mimics. We found that treating cells with 10 μg/ml 
      of HPE, 30 μM procyanidin B2, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, or resveratrol 
      (positive control) significantly reduced ROS production and decreased apoptosis 
      and inflammation-related factors (p < .01). Moreover, the expression level of 
      SIRT1 was increased, while that of acetylated NF-κB p65 and p53 proteins was 
      decreased. These data suggest that HPE can inhibit oxidative damage, 
      inflammation, and apoptosis through the AMPK/SIRT1/NF-κB pathway, and decrease 
      miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 pathway activation in ARPE-19 cells, thereby demonstrating a 
      potential use as a food additive to mitigate hyperglycemia-induced retinal 
      damage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Hawthorn polyphenol extract (HPE) significantly 
      reduced ROS levels, apoptosis, and the expression of inflammation-related factors 
      in ARPE-19 cells. HPE also inhibited the AMPK/SIRT1/NF-κB and miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 
      pathways, which are involved in hyperglycemia-induced inflammation and apoptosis 
      of ARPE-19 cells by regulating acetylation. Thus, HPE, as a potential food 
      additive, may mitigate hyperglycemia-induced retinal damage.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gnaphalium affine D. Don is an important 
      Traditional Chinese herbal Medicine (TCM) used to treat hyperuricemia, asthma, 
      rheumatic arthritis, antitussive, expectorant and cardiovascular in folk medicine 
      because of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity. The aim of this study was 
      to investigate the potential beneficial effect of G. affine extract (GAE) on 
      hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced apoptosis and explore the possible 
      underlying mechanism in cardiomyocyte. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ingredients of 
      GAE were isolated and tentatively identified by HPLC-ESI-Q-Qribatrip-MS/MS. The 
      cardioprotective and anti-oxidant effects of GAE were evaluated in the 
      experimental model with H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. H9c2 cells were 
      pretreated for 3 h with or without GAE or with GAE plus PX866 (PI3K inhibitor), 
      then exposed to H(2)O(2) for 6 h, H9c2 cells viability were detected by CCK8 kit, 
      the content of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde 
      (MDA) and intracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by the 
      commercial biochemical kits, western blotting, immunohistochemical (IHC), 
      immunofluorescence (IF) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR) assays were performed to evaluate the proteins and mRNA expression, 
      propidium iodide (PI) staining was adopted to indicate H9c2 cells apoptosis. 
      RESULTS: Firstly, seventeen polyphenols and flavonoids compounds with the 
      characteristics of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant in GAE were tentatively 
      identified by HPLC-ESI-Q-Qribatrip-MS/MS. In the experimental model, GAE not only 
      significantly improved cells viability, but also showed anti-oxidant effects 
      through improving SOD activity, up-regulating nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 
      (Nrf2), and decreasing intracellular concentration of ROS and MDA and the 
      proteins expression of p47(phox), p67(phox) and gp91(phox). On the other hand, 
      GAE revealed anti-apoptotic effect through up-regulating the expression of B-cell 
      lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), down-regulating Bcl2-associated X (BAX) and cleaved-caspase 
      3. Furthermore, GAE significantly facilitated phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen 
      synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) but not AMPK, while the effects were blocked by 
      PX866 (PI3K inhibitor). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that GAE showed strong 
      anti-oxidant effect to ameliorate oxidative stress and attenuate apoptosis 
      induced by H(2)O(2) in H9c2 cells by targeting PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway.

TI  - Involvement of exogenous 3‑deoxyglucosone in β‑cell dysfunction induces impaired 
      glucose regulation.
PG  - 2976-2984
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2017.6856 [doi]
AB  - β‑cell dysfunction is the primary cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      1,2‑dicarbonyl compounds, such as 3‑deoxyglucosone (3DG) have been reported to 
      increase the risk of T2DM. Abnormal elevation of plasma 3DG may impair β‑cell 
      function and thereby, it is linked to T2DM. Previous findings suggest that 
      exogenous 3DG may serve an important role in the development of pre‑diabetes. In 
      the present study, the authors examine whether exogenous 3DG induces impaired 
      glucose regulation in mice by decreasing β‑cell function involving of 
      accumulation of plasma 3DG. At two weeks following administration of 3DG, fasting 
      blood glucose (FBG) levels, oral glucose tolerance (by a glucose meter) and 
      plasma levels of 3DG (by HPLC) and insulin (by radioimmunoassay) were measured. 
      Glucose‑stimulated insulin secretion in cultured pancreas islets and INS‑1 cells 
      was measured by radioimmunoassay. Western blotting was used to examine the 
      expression of the key molecules of the insulin‑PI3K signaling pathway. 3DG 
      treatment increased FBG and fasting blood insulin levels, reduced oral glucose 
      tolerance in conjunction with decreased ∆Ins30‑0/∆G30‑0. In 3DG‑treated mice, an 
      increase in the plasma 3DG level was observed, which was most likely the 
      mechanism for decreased β‑cell function. This idea was further supported by these 
      results that non‑cytotoxic 3DG concentration obviously decreased 
      glucose‑stimulated insulin secretion in cultured pancreas islets and INS‑1 cells 
      exposure to high glucose (25.5 mM). 3DG decreased the expression of GLUT2 and 
      phosphorylation of IRS‑1, PI3K‑p85 and Akt in high glucose‑induced INS‑1 cells. 
      To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first to 
      demonstrate that exogenous 3DG induced normal mice to develop IGR, resulting from 
      β‑cell dysfunction. Exogenous 3DG administration increased plasma 3DG levels, 
      which participates in inducing β‑cell dysfunction, at least in part, through 
      impairing IRS‑1/PI3K/GLUT2 signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Castanea mollissima Blume (Chinese chestnut), as a food product is 
      known for its various nutrients and functional values to the human health. The 
      present study was carried out to analyze the anti-diabetic complications and 
      anti-cancer activities of the bioactive compounds present in C. mollissima. 
      METHODS: The kernels (CK), shells (CS) and involucres (CI) parts of C. Blume were 
      extracted with 90% alcohol. The water suspension of these dried alcohol extracts 
      were extracted using EtOAc and n-BuOH successively. The n-BuOH fraction of CI 
      (CI-B) was isolated by silica gel column, Sephadex LH 20 column and preparative 
      HPLC. The isolated compounds were identified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, HMBC, HMQC and 
      ESI-Q-TOF MS, All the fractions and compounds isolated were evaluated on human 
      recombinant aldose reductase (HR-AR) assay, advanced glycation end products 
      (AGEs) formation assay and human COLO 320 DM colon cancer cells inhibitory assay. 
      RESULTS: CI-B was found to show a significant inhibitory effect in above 
      biological screenings. Six flavonoids and three polyphenolic acids were obtained 
      from CI-B. They were identified as kaempferol (1), 
      kaempferol-3-O-[6''-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl]-β-D-glucopyranoside (2), 
      kaempferol-3-O-[6''-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl]-β-D-galactopyranoside (3), 
      kaempferol-3-O-[2''-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl]-β-D-glucopyranoside (4), 
      kaempferol-3-O-[2", 6"-di-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl]-β-D-glucopyranoside (5) and 
      kaempferol-3-O-[2", 6"-di-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl]-β-D-galactopyranoside (6), casuariin 
      (7), casuarinin (8) and castalagin (9). Compounds 2-9 were found to show higher 
      activity than quercetin (positive control) in the AR assay. Compounds 3-6, 8, and 
      9 showed stronger inhibitory effects than amino guanidine (positive control) on 
      AGEs production. Compounds 4-6, 7, and 8 showed much higher cytotoxic activity 
      than 5-fluorouracil (positive control) against the human COLO 320 DM colon cancer 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that flavonoids and polyphenolic acids 
      possesses anti-diabetes complications and anti-cancer properties, and they were 
      presumed to be the bioactive components of Castanea mollissima Blume.

TI  - Curcumin metabolites contribute to the effect of curcumin on ameliorating insulin 
      sensitivity in high-glucose-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL EVIDENCE: Curcumin (CUR) is the active ingredient of 
      Traditional Chinese Medicine turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), which has been used for 
      treatment of diabetes in Ayurveda and China. CUR exerts potent 
      anti-insulin-resistant effects in various cell lines. However, previous studies 
      indicated CUR was metabolized extensively in vivo and massively degraded in a 
      medium alkaline buffer solution. The real active component of the 
      anti-insulin-resistant activity of CUR in vitro is not clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: 
      Our study identified the functional contribution of the metabolites of CUR and 
      the related molecular mechanism in improving insulin sensitivity. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: HPLC and UPLC-QQQ-MS analyses were used to investigate the stability and 
      metabolism of CUR in HepG2 cells. The effect of the metabolic products of CUR on 
      insulin sensitivity was evaluated in high glucose (HG)-induced insulin-resistant 
      HepG2 cells. A network pharmacology approach was used to examine the potential 
      targets of the metabolites, and Western blotting was performed to verify changes 
      in the targets. RESULTS: CUR was unstable in the cell culture medium, but the 
      prototypes, metabolites and degradation products of CUR coexisted in the HepG2 
      cell culture experiment. The insulin sensitivity assay demonstrated that CUR and 
      its metabolites enhanced insulin sensitivity in HG-induced insulin-resistant 
      HepG2 cells, but the total degradation products of CUR may not play the major 
      role. Similar to CUR, hexahydrocurcumin (HHC) and octahydrocurcumin (OHC) 
      improved insulin sensitivity by strengthening the PI3K-AKT-GSK3B signal and 
      suppressing the phosphorylation of ERK/JNK in HG-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolites of CUR played a critical role in counteracting 
      insulin resistance in HG-induced HepG2 cells. CUR exerted anti-insulin resistance 
      effect in HepG2 cells in a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway 
      manner.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dacryodes edulis L. is an evergreen tree 
      indigenous to western and eastern Africa which is utilized for nutritional and 
      medicinal purposes. Folklorically, different parts of the tree are used in 
      treating and managing diabetes and its complications. AIMS: The antidiabetic 
      effect of the butanol fraction of D. edulis ethanol extract (BFDE) was studied in 
      fructose-streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetic rats. METHODS: The ethanol 
      extract was fractionated to yield the hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, 
      butanol and aqueous fractions. The in vitro antidiabetic activities of the 
      fractions were determined by their ability to inhibit α-glucosidase activity. 
      BDFE was the most active and showed no cytotoxic effect while stimulating glucose 
      uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, selected for in vivo study. Diabetic rats were 
      grouped into 4. The negative control group was administered water only, another 
      group was treated with metformin (200 mg/kg bodyweight), while the other groups 
      were administered BDFE at 150 and 300 mg/kg bodyweight respectively. Two other 
      groups consisting of normal rats were given water and BFDE (300 mg/kg bodyweight) 
      respectively, with the former serving as normal control. After 6 weeks of 
      intervention, the rats were humanely sacrificed using appropriate anaesthesia. 
      RESULTS: Treatment with the fraction significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the blood 
      glucose level of the diabetic rats, with concomitant increase in serum insulin 
      secretion. It also caused significant (p < 0.05) elevation of reduced glutathione 
      level, superoxide dismutase, catalase, α-amylase, and ATPase activities, with 
      concomitant depletion in myeloperoxidase activity, NO and MDA levels of the serum 
      and pancreas. The pancreatic morphology and β-cell function were significantly 
      improved in BFDE-treated rats, with restoration of the pancreatic capillary 
      networks. Treatment with BFDE significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the activities 
      of glycogen phosphorylase, fructose 1,6 biphosphatase, glucose 6 phosphatase, and 
      acetylcholinesterase, while suppressing the expression of Nrf2. HPLC analysis 
      revealed the presence of gallic acid, vanillic acid, vanillin, and 
      (-)-epicatechin in the fraction. CONCLUSION: These results portray the 
      antidiabetic and antioxidative properties of BFDE, which may be a synergistic 
      consequence of the identified phenolics.

      comparative analysis among populations across the Southern Western Ghats of 
      India.

AB  - Lagerstroemia speciosa commonly known as 'Banaba' is native of south-east Asia 
      which exhibits both horticultural and therapeutic value. The anti-diabetic and 
      anti-obese property of the tree is attributed to corosolic acid (CRA)-a 
      pentacyclic triterpene seen predominantly in the mature leaves. Although there 
      are studies on either chemical or genetic variation in L. speciosa from different 
      regions, none have dealt with their association to discuss the formation of 
      chemical diversity. For the first time, we have analyzed CRA content in 12 
      natural populations corresponding to 42 samples seen in the Southern Western 
      Ghats (SWG) using chromatography techniques and genetic variation estimated using 
      SSR markers. Significant variation in percentage distribution of CRA ranging from 
      0.005% to 0.868% dr.wt. was recorded wherein populations from the north SWG 
      contain relatively more active principle (mean=0.321%) than their counterparts in 
      the south (mean=0.064%). Similarly, SSR data showing relatively high rate of gene 
      flow (Nm=2.72) and low genetic differentiation (FST=0.14) is indicative that 
      populations from north are genetically more diverse than those in the south 
      (Nm=0.48; FST=0.38). The scatter plot derived by Principle Component Analysis 
      (PCA) of chemical and genetic data shows similar pattern of clustering that 
      reveals strong association between the two sets of data. It is concluded that the 
      observed variation in CRA content in natural populations of the species depends 
      more on the genetic background and less on edaphic factors.

TI  - Protein modification by the degradation products of ascorbate: formation of a 
      novel pyrrole from the Maillard reaction of L-threose with proteins.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - Ascorbate (vitamin C) degradation products can undergo non-enzymatic glycation 
      (Maillard reaction) with proteins to form highly crosslinked structures with 
      brown pigmentation and characteristic fluorescence. Proteins in the body, 
      especially the long-lived proteins develop similar changes during aging and 
      diabetes. Several studies have shown excessive degradation of ascorbate in plasma 
      in diabetes, and in ocular lens during aging and cataract formation. Recent 
      studies have suggested that ascorbate degradation products-mediated glycation 
      plays a role in lens pigmentation and cataract formation. However, the precise 
      chemical nature of ascorbate-specific advanced glycation end-products are not 
      known. Here, we report the purification and characterization of a glycation 
      end-product derived from one of the major degradation products of ascorbate, 
      L-threose. This compound was characterized to be 
      2-acetamido-6-(3-(1,2-dihydroxyethyl)-2-formyl-4-hydroxymethyl-1- 
      pyrrolyl)hexanoic acid (formyl threosyl pyrrole or FTP) formed by the 
      condensation of epsilon-amino group of lysine with two molecules of threose. 
      Formation of FTP occurred rapidly in the incubation of threose and lysine and 
      reached plateau level within a day. We have developed a sensitive assay for its 
      quantification in proteins based on enzyme digestion followed by HPLC. 
      Ribonuclease A and human lens crystallins incubated with L-threose showed time- 
      and sugar concentration-dependent increases in FTP, reaching 8.2 and 2.48 nmol 
      per mg protein, respectively after one week of incubation. Human plasma proteins 
      showed a peak with identical retention time as that of purified FTP under two 
      different HPLC conditions. FTP may be used as a sensitive marker to assess 
      ascorbate-mediated protein glycation and modifications in aging and diabetes.

TI  - Dual Functionality of Papaya Leaf Extracts: Anti-Coronavirus Activity and 
      Anti-Inflammation Mechanism.
LID - 10.3390/foods13203274 [doi]
LID - 3274
AB  - Papaya leaves have been used as food and traditional herbs for the treatment of 
      cancer, diabetes, asthma, and virus infections, but the active principle has not 
      been understood. We hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory activity could be the 
      predominant underlying principle. To test this, we extracted papaya leaf juice 
      with different organic solvents and found that the ethyl acetate (EA) fraction 
      showed the most outstanding anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing the 
      production of nitric oxide (NO, IC(50) = 24.94 ± 2.4 μg/mL) and the expression of 
      pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 
      cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and cytokines including interleukins (IL-1β and IL-6), 
      and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 
      cells. Transcriptomic analysis and Western blot results revealed its 
      anti-inflammatory mechanisms were through the MAPK signaling pathway by 
      inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNKs, and p38 and the prevention of the 
      cell surface expression of TLR4. Furthermore, we discovered that the EA fraction 
      could inhibit the replication of alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and 
      beta-coronavirus (HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) and might be able to prevent cytokine 
      storms caused by the coronavirus infection. From HPLC-QTOF-MS data, we found that 
      the predominant phytochemicals that existed in the EA fraction were quercetin and 
      kaempferol glycosides and carpaine. Counter-intuitively, further fractionation 
      resulted in a loss of activity, suggesting that the synergistic effect of 
      different components in the EA fraction contribute to the overall potent 
      activity. Taken together, our results provide preliminary evidence for papaya 
      leaf as a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-coronavirus agent, warranting 
      further study for its use for human health promotion.

AB  - The current epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is attributed to a high 
      carbohydrate diet, containing mainly high fructose corn syrup and sucrose. More 
      than two thirds of diabetic patients have hypertension. Methylglyoxal is a highly 
      reactive dicarbonyl generated during glucose and fructose metabolism, and a major 
      precursor of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Plasma methylglyoxal levels 
      are increased in hypertensive rats and diabetic patients. Our aim was to examine 
      the levels of methylglyoxal, mediators of the renin angiotensin system and blood 
      pressure in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a high fructose diet (60% of 
      total calories) for 4 months. The thoracic aorta and kidney were used for 
      molecular studies, along with cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). 
      HPLC, Western blotting and Q-PCR were used to measure methylglyoxal and reduced 
      glutathione (GSH), proteins and mRNA, respectively. Fructose treated rats 
      developed a significant increase in blood pressure. Methylglyoxal level and 
      protein and mRNA for angiotensin II, AT1 receptor, adrenergic α1D receptor and 
      renin were significantly increased, whereas GSH levels were decreased, in the 
      aorta and/or kidney of fructose fed rats. The protein expression of the receptor 
      for AGEs (RAGE) and NF-κB were also significantly increased in the aorta of 
      fructose fed rats. MG treated VSMCs showed increased protein for angiotensin II, 
      AT1 receptor, and α1D receptor. The effects of methylglyoxal were attenuated by 
      metformin, a methylglyoxal scavenger and AGEs inhibitor. In conclusion, we report 
      a strong association between elevated levels of methylglyoxal, RAGE, NF-κB, 
      mediators of the renin angiotensin system and blood pressure in high fructose 
      diet fed rats.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Blue honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. edulis) 
      berry has been used in folk medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections, 
      gastrointestinal disorders, and metabolic diseases. There is evidence to support 
      its pharmacological effects in improving diabetes, fatty liver, and obesity. AIM 
      OF STUDY: To investigate the effect of blue honeysuckle berry extract (BHBE) on 
      lipid accumulation in adipocytes and the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass 
      spectrometry (MS) was applied to analyze the polyphenolic compounds in BHBE. 
      3T3-L1 cells were used to induce into adipocytes. Oil Red O staining combined 
      with triglyceride (TG) content determination were carried out to evaluate 
      intracellular lipid accumulation. Western blot was used to determine the 
      expression of lipogenic enzymes and transcription factors. Real-time PCR was used 
      to determine the expression of lipolytic enzymes and adipocyte markers. RESULTS: 
      The primary polyphenols in BHBE are flavonoids (mainly flavonols and 
      anthocyanins). BHBE dose-dependently inhibited lipid accumulation in adipocytes 
      by reducing the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and increasing the 
      phosphorylation level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Moreover, BHBE was found 
      to promote the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and further 
      reduce the expression of lipogenic transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα, and 
      SREBP-1c), while the selective AMPK inhibitor attenuated the suppressive effect 
      of BHBE on lipogenesis. In addition, BHBE increased the expression of beige 
      adipocyte markers (Cd137 and Tmem26) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) without 
      affecting the expression of brown adipocyte markers (Ebf3 and Eva1). CONCLUSION: 
      BHBE inhibits lipid accumulation in adipocytes by suppressing lipogenesis via 
      AMPK activation as well as by promoting beiging of adipocytes, which supports the 
      anti-obesity potential of blue honeysuckle berry.

TI  - Cordyceps militaris polysaccharides exerted protective effects on diabetic 
      nephropathy in mice via regulation of autophagy.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the protective effects of Cordyceps 
      militaris polysaccharides (CMP) on STZ-treated DN mice. CMP were identified by 
      FT-IR and HPLC. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by the 
      injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg kg(-1)) in citrate buffer on 5 
      consecutive days. Administration of CMP at 200 and 400 mg kg(-1) or irbesartan at 
      60 mg kg(-1) in the STZ-treated mice could prevent the damage caused by STZ. CMP 
      significantly reduced the STZ-induced higher expression of the kidney index, TC, 
      TG, MDA, urinary protein, Scr, and BUN, while it markedly increased the 
      STZ-induced decrease in GSH levels compared with the DN group. Histopathology 
      analysis of the kidney by PAS, Masson, and HE staining confirmed the renal injury 
      induced by STZ and the protective effects of CMP. Transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM) results confirmed the severe foot process effacement induced by 
      STZ, but CMP treatment inhibited the podocytes' structure defects and ameliorated 
      the function of podocytes. Desmin was measured by immunofluorescence and was 
      related to podocyte injury. The results showed that CMP lessened the expression 
      of desmin induced by STZ. CD68 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry 
      analysis, and the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1 mRNA were measured by 
      qRT-PCR. The results showed that CMP suppressed the expressions of CD68, IL-1β, 
      IL-6, and MCP-1 mRNA induced by STZ. The role of autophagy in the treatment of DN 
      mice with CMP was detected by TEM and western blotting. The results showed that 
      the administration of CMP was able to overcome the STZ-treated autophagy 
      deficiency, significantly increase the rate of autophagy in the kidney, promote 
      the expression of Atg5, beclin1 and LC3 protein, and reduce the expression of p62 
      protein. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that CMP exert a 
      protective effect on DN in STZ-treated mice possibly via activation of autophagy.

TI  - Ameliorative Effects of Malonyl Ginsenoside from Panax ginseng on Glucose-Lipid 
      Metabolism and Insulin Resistance via IRS1/PI3K/Akt and AMPK Signaling Pathways 
      in Type 2 Diabetic Mice.
PG  - 863-882

AB  - Our previous study has revealed that malonyl-ginsenosides from Panax ginseng 
      (PG-MGR) play a crucial role in the treatment of T2DM. However, its potential 
      mechanism was still unclear. In this study, we investigated the anti-diabetic 
      mechanisms of action of PG-MGR in high fat diet-fed (HFD) and 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and determined the main constituents of 
      PG-MGR responsible for its anti-diabetic effects. Our results showed that 16 
      malonyl ginsenosides were identified in PG-MGR by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. PG-MGR 
      treatment significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), 
      total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 
      and improved insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Simultaneously, PG-MGR 
      treatment improved liver injury by decreasing aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
      and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) expression. Furthermore, Western blot analysis 
      demonstrated that the protein expression levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, 
      p-AMPK/AMPK, p-ACC/ACC and GLUT4 in liver and skeletal muscle were significantly 
      up-regulated after PG-MGR treatment, and the protein expression levels of 
      p-IRS-1/IRS-1, Fas and SREBP-1c were significantly reduced. These findings 
      revealed that PG-MGR has the potential to improve glucose and lipid metabolism 
      and insulin resistance by activating the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT and AMPK signal pathways.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the serum paraoxonase 1 activity and determine its association 
      with duration in type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients. METHODS: A total of 80 cases 
      from type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls were enrolled in the present 
      case control study. Human serum PON1 concentration was measured by ELISA and 
      western blotting and it activity was determined spectrophotometrically using 
      4-nitrophenyle acetate. Diagnostic accuracy of serum PON1 to identify type 2 
      Diabetes mellitus was calculated with ROC analysis. RESULT: Serum concentration 
      of LDL, VLDL, TG, A1C, FBS and TC levels showed significantly higher levels in 
      type 2 diabetes patients as compared to healthy controls, however there were no 
      significant differences found in the level of HDL. Serum PON1 concentration and 
      activity monitored in patients with >1 year diabetes showed higher level 
      (75.1 ± 6.8 ng/mL) as compared to patients with >3 years diabetes 
      (65.24 ± 1.6 ng/mL), its level was further decreased in patients with >5 
      (53.8 ± 2.6 ng/mL) and >7 years (48.1 ± 2.7 ng/mL) of diabetes. PON1 
      concentration decreased as the duration of diabetes increased. PON1 level was 
      further decreased due to habits like smoking and alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: 
      Serum PON1 levels decrease in states of high oxidative stress like metabolic 
      syndrome, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, and dyslipidemia. It can be used as 
      diagnostic marker for diabetes mellitus along with increased TG, LDL, VLDL and 
      FBG.

TI  - Effects of Compound Centella on Oxidative Stress and Keap1-Nrf2-ARE Pathway 
      Expression in Diabetic Kidney Disease Rats.
PG  - 9817932

AB  - The formula of Compound Centella mainly contains 3 traditional Chinese herbs: 
      Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. (JiXueCao), Astragalus Membranaceus Fish. (HuangQi), 
      and Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (LeiGongTeng). Though this formula is 
      effective for treating diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in clinic, the exact 
      mechanism is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect and 
      antioxidant mechanism of Compound Centella on DKD rats. High-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) was applied to analyse 3 herbs in Compound Centella. 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the normal group (NG), DKD group (DKDG), 
      Compound Centella group (CCG), and losartan group (LG), with 8 rats in each 
      group. On the first day of the experiment, rats in the NG were fed with ordinary 
      -feed, while the other groups were fed with high-fat and high-sugar feed. On the 
      29(th) day, except the NG, the other 3 groups received a single intraperitoneal 
      injection of streptozocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg). Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was 
      measured on the 1(st) day, 32(nd) day, 46(th) day, 56(th) day, 84(th) day, and 
      112(th) day. Total protein/creatinine ratio of urine was determined by the phenol 
      red assay on the 1(st) day and 112(th) day. Serum creatinine (Scr) was determined 
      by an automatic biochemical analyser on the 112(th) day. Kidneys were collected 
      on the 112(th) day for analysis and evaluation. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) 
      staining, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and transmission electron microscopy 
      were used to observe kidney pathological changes. The mRNA and protein 
      expressions of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and nuclear 
      factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in renal tissues were detected by 
      RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Oxidative stress was evaluated 
      by detecting the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and heme oxidase-1 (HO-1). The 
      results showed that the content of asiaticoside, astragaloside, and triptolide in 
      the herb was 5960, 809, and 2.42 μg/g and in the Compound Centella was 340, 64, 
      and 0.1403 μg/mL by HPLC. Compound Centella reduced the urine protein/creatinine 
      ratio and improved renal pathology in the kidneys of DKD rats. In addition, the 
      mRNA and protein expressions of Keap1 and Nrf2 in kidneys were upregulated by 
      Compound Centella. The expressions of MDA were downregulated but HO-1 were 
      upregulated by Compound Centella. Therefore, the protective effect of Compound 
      Centella in the kidney of DKD rats may be related to regulating the 
      Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway under oxidative stress, suggesting Compound Centella as a 
      promising treatment against DKD.

TI  - Dietary wolfberry upregulates carotenoid metabolic genes and enhances 
      mitochondrial biogenesis in the retina of db/db diabetic mice.
PG  - 1158-69

AB  - SCOPE: Our aim was to investigate whether dietary wolfberry altered carotenoid 
      metabolic gene expression and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in the retina of 
      diabetic mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six-week-old male db/db and wild-type mice 
      were fed the control or wolfberry diets for 8 weeks. At study termination, liver 
      and retinal tissues were collected for analysis by transmission electron 
      microscopy, real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and HPLC. Wolfberry 
      elevated zeaxanthin and lutein levels in the liver and retinal tissues and 
      stimulated expression of retinal scavenger receptor class B type I, glutathione 
      S-transferase Pi 1, and β,β-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase 2, and induced activation 
      and nuclear enrichment of retinal AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPK-α2). 
      Furthermore, wolfberry attenuated hypoxia and mitochondrial stress as 
      demonstrated by declined expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-α, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor, and heat shock protein 60. Wolfberry enhanced retinal 
      mitochondrial biogenesis in diabetic retinas as demonstrated by reversed 
      mitochondrial dispersion in the retinal pigment epithelium, increased 
      mitochondrial copy number, elevated citrate synthase activity, and upregulated 
      expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α, 
      nuclear respiratory factor 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A. 
      CONCLUSION: Consumption of dietary wolfberry could be beneficial to 
      retinoprotection through reversal of mitochondrial function in diabetic mice.

TI  - Tough decoy targeting of predominant let-7 miRNA species in adult human 
      hematopoietic cells.
PG  - 169
LID - 10.1186/s12967-017-1273-x [doi]
LID - 169
AB  - BACKGROUND: In humans, the heterochronic cascade composed of the RNA-binding 
      protein LIN28 and its major target, the let-7 family of microRNAs (miRNAs), is 
      highly regulated during human erythroid ontogeny. Additionally, down-regulation 
      of the let-7 miRNAs in cultured adult CD34(+) cells or the over-expression of 
      LIN28 in cultured erythrocytes from pediatric patients with HbSS genotype causes 
      increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in the range of 19-40% of the total. 
      Therefore, we hypothesized that focused targeting of individual let-7 miRNA 
      family members would exhibit regulatory effect on HbF expression in human adult 
      erythroblasts. METHODS: The expression levels of mature let-7 family members were 
      measured by RT-qPCR in purified cell populations sorted from peripheral blood. To 
      study the effects of let-7 miRNAs upon globin expression, a lentiviral construct 
      that incorporated the tough decoy (TuD) design to target let-7a or let-7b was 
      compared with empty vector controls. Transductions were performed in CD34(+) 
      cells from adult healthy volunteers cultivated ex vivo in 
      erythropoietin-supplemented serum-free media for 21 days. Downstream analyses 
      included RT-qPCR, Western blot and HPLC for the characterization of adult and 
      fetal hemoglobins. RESULTS: The expression of individual let-7 miRNA family 
      members in adult peripheral blood cell populations demonstrated that let-7a and 
      let-7b miRNAs are expressed at much higher levels than the other let-7 family 
      members in purified adult human blood cell subsets with expression being 
      predominantly in reticulocytes. Therefore, we focused this study upon the 
      targeted inhibition of let-7a and let-7b with the TuD design to explore its 
      effects upon developmentally-timed erythroid genes. Let-7a-TuD transductions 
      significantly increased gamma-globin mRNA expression and HbF to an average of 
      38%. Let-7a-TuD also significantly decreased the mRNA expression of some 
      ontogeny-regulated erythroid genes, namely CA1 and GCNT2. In addition, the 
      erythroid-related transcription factors BCL11A and HMGA2 were down- and 
      up-regulated, respectively, by let-7a-TuD, while ZBTB7A, KLF1 and SOX6 remained 
      unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrate that let-7 miRNAs are 
      differentially expressed in human hematopoietic cells, and that targeted 
      inhibition of the highly-expressed species of this family is sufficient for 
      developmentally-specific changes in gamma-globin expression and HbF levels.

TI  - Src Is a Prime Target Inhibited by Celtis choseniana Methanol Extract in Its 
      Anti-Inflammatory Action.

AB  - Celtis choseniana is the traditional plant used at Korea as a herbal medicine to 
      ameliorate inflammatory responses. Although Celtis choseniana has been 
      traditionally used as a herbal medicine at Korea, no systemic research has been 
      conducted on its anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, the present study 
      explored an anti-inflammatory effect and its underlying molecular mechanism using 
      Celtis choseniana methanol extract (Cc-ME) in macrophage-mediated inflammatory 
      responses. In vitro anti-inflammatory activity of Cc-ME was evaluated using 
      RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 
      pam3CSK4 (Pam3), or poly(I:C). In vivo anti-inflammatory activity of Cc-ME was 
      investigated using acute inflammatory disease mouse models, such as LPS-induced 
      peritonitis and HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis. The molecular mechanism of 
      Cc-ME-mediated anti-inflammatory activity was examined by Western blot analysis 
      and immunoprecipitation using whole cell and nuclear fraction prepared from the 
      LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and HEK293 cells. Cc-ME inhibited NO production and 
      mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 
      (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the RAW264.7 cells and 
      peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS, pam3, or poly(I:C) without cytotoxicity. 
      High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that Cc-ME 
      contained anti-inflammatory flavonoids quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol. Among 
      those, the content of luteolin, which showed an inhibitory effect on NO 
      production, was highest. Cc-ME suppressed the NF-κB signaling pathway by 
      targeting Src and interrupting molecular interactions between Src and p85, its 
      downstream kinase. Moreover, Cc-ME ameliorated the morphological finding of 
      peritonitis and gastritis in the mouse disease models. Therefore, these results 
      suggest that Cc-ME exerted in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in 
      LPS-stimulated macrophages and mouse models of acute inflammatory diseases. This 
      anti-inflammatory activity of Cc-ME was dominantly mediated by targeting Src in 
      NF-κB signaling pathway during macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses.

TI  - DPP-4 Inhibitor Linagliptin Ameliorates Oxidized LDL-Induced THP-1 Macrophage 
      Foam Cell Formation and Inflammation.
PG  - 3929-3940
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S249846 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of cardiovascular 
      diseases. Lipid uptake and accumulation in macrophages play a major role in 
      atherosclerotic plaque formation from its initiation to advanced atheroma 
      formation. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor Linagliptin is commonly 
      used to lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes patients. Recent studies report 
      that Linagliptin has cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects. 
      METHODS: THP-1 macrophage cells were treated with 100 nM PMA for 72 hour to 
      induce foam cell formation. The differentiated cells were exposed to 100 μg/mL 
      ox-LDL in the presence or absence of the DPP-4 inhibitor Linagliptin. The 
      expression levels of DPP-4 and inflammatory cytokines were detected by RT-PCR, 
      ELISA, and Western blot experiments. The cellular ROS level was measured by 
      staining the cells with the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. The separation of 
      lipoprotein fractions was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC). The cells were labeled with fluorescent-labeled cholesterol to measure 
      cholesterol efflux, and lipid droplets were revealed by Nile red staining. 
      RESULTS: The presence of Linagliptin significantly reduced ox-LDL-induced 
      cytokine production (IL-1β and IL-6) and ROS production. Linagliptin ameliorated 
      ox-LDL-induced lipid accumulation and impaired cholesterol efflux in macrophages. 
      Mechanistically, this study showed that Linagliptin mitigated ox-LDL-induced 
      expression of the scavenger receptors CD36 and LOX-1, but not SRA. Furthermore, 
      Linagliptin increased the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCG1, but 
      not ABCA1. CONCLUSION: Linagliptin possesses a potent inhibitory effect on THP-1 
      macrophage-derived foam cell formation in response to ox-LDL. This effect could 
      be mediated through a decrease in the expression of CD36 and LOX-1 on macrophages 
      and an increase in the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCG1. This 
      study indicates that the DPP-4 inhibitor Linagliptin plays a critical role in 
      preventing foam cell formation in vitro. However, future research using an 
      atherosclerotic animal model is necessary to determine its effectiveness and to 
      prove its potential implication in the prevention and treatment of 
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Processing of chromogranins/secretogranin in patients with diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 118-24
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2010.12.004 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Inflammation has been linked to the development of diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR). Chromogranins A, B (CgA, CgB) and secretogranin II (SgII), are prohormones 
      overexpressed in inflammatory diseases. The present study was conducted to 
      evaluate the presence and processing of these prohormones in the vitreous of 
      patients with DR (DV), compared with nondiabetic vitreous (NDV). METHODS: 
      Thirteen DV and 14 NDV samples were collected during vitreoretinal surgery. 
      ELISA, Western blot, RP-HPLC, dot blot, protein sequencing and mass spectrometry 
      were used to study the quantitative expression and the processing of CgA, CgB and 
      SgII. RESULTS: CgA, CgB and SgII presence was higher in DV than in NDV. Mean 
      concentration of CgA evaluated by ELISA was 90.8 (± 90.1) n L⁻¹ in DV vs. 29.7 
      (±20.9) in NDV (p=0.039). In NDV, Western blot indicated that only short 
      CgB-derived peptides were identified. In DV, proteomic analyses showed that long 
      CgA-, CgB- and SgII-derived fragments and α1-antitrypsin were overexpressed, 
      suggesting possible inhibition of the proteolytic process. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study shows differences in the presence and endogenous processing of CgA, CgB and 
      SgII from DV vs. NDV. In DV, the increase of complete granins and the attenuation 
      of their endogenous proteolytic processing could participate in DR progression by 
      reducing the presence of regulatory peptides, important for the 
      pro-/anti-angiogenic balance in the eye.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that severely affects 
      human health, but the pathogenesis of the disease remains unknown. The 
      high-fat/high-sucrose diets combined with streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced nonhuman 
      primate animal model of diabetes are a valuable research source of T2DM. Here, we 
      present a study of a STZ rhesus macaque model of T2DM that utilizes quantitative 
      iTRAQ-based proteomic method. We compared the protein profiles in the liver of 
      STZ-treated macaques as well as age-matched healthy controls. We identified 171 
      proteins differentially expressed in the STZ-treated groups, about 70 of which 
      were documented as diabetes-related gene in previous studies. Pathway analyses 
      indicated that the biological functions of differentially expressed proteins were 
      related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, complements, and 
      coagulation cascades. Expression change in tryptophan metabolism pathway was also 
      found in this study which may be associations with diabetes. This study is the 
      first to explore genome-wide protein expression in hepatic tissue of diabetes 
      macaque model using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS technology. In addition to providing potential 
      T2DM biomarkers, this quantitative proteomic study may also shed insights 
      regarding the molecular pathogenesis of T2DM.

TI  - Role of age-related decrease of renal organic cation transporter 2 in the effect 
      of atenolol on renal excretion of metformin in rats.

AB  - Many diabetes patients, especially the elder ones, suffered from hypertension 
      simultaneously. Therefore, it is very likely that a large number of diabetes 
      patients receiving metformin hydrochloride may simultaneously be given 
      beta-blockers. Knowing that both metformin and atenolol are eliminated by organic 
      cation transporter 2 (OCT2/SLC22A2) expressed in the renal basolateral membrane, 
      it is not clear whether there is a competitive effect on the renal excretion of 
      metformin and/or atenolol when metformin and atenolol were co-administered, and 
      whether age was involved in this drug-drug interaction. In this present study, 
      both young rats (aged 3 months) and aged rats (aged 12 months) were used, rats 
      were divided into metformin-treated group and metformin and atenolol 
      co-administrated group, respectively. Either metformin (2.5 mg/kg) alone or 
      metformin (2.5 mg/kg) in combination with atenolol (8 mg/kg) was administered to 
      rats by tail vein injection. Then, urine was collected and the metformin 
      concentration in urine was determined by HPLC. The localization and expression of 
      rOCT2 in kidney were also investigated by Western blotting and 
      immunohistochemistry. Significant differences of t 1/2, K e, CLtot and the 
      accumulated metformin excretion in urine were founded in aged rats, but not in 
      young rats, between metformin-treated group (2.002 ± 0.51 h, 0.346 ± 0.07/h, 
      57.161 ± 18.59 %, 4,287.087 ± 458.08 μg) and metformin plus atenolol-treated 
      group (3.03 ± 0.67 h, 0.228 ± 0.05/h, 43.199 ± 10.28 %, 3,239.972 ± 446.61 μg). 
      Moreover, a significant age-related decrease in rOCT2 protein expression was 
      observed in the aged rats (P < 0.01), which may be responsible for the effect of 
      atenolol on the renal excretion of metformin in the aged rats. In conclusion, 
      there is a drug-drug interaction between atenolol and metformin, and more 
      attention should be paid when atenolol and metformin were co-administered to the 
      aged people inclinical.

AB  - This study was to investigate the anti-diabetic effects and molecular mechanisms 
      of Tang-Kang-Fu-San (TKFS), a traditional Tibetan medicine, in treating type 2 
      diabetes mellitus of spontaneous diabetic db/db mice. Firstly HPLC fingerprint 
      analysis was performed to gain the features of the chemical compositions of TKFS. 
      Next different doses of TKFS (0.5 g/kg, 1.0 g/kg, and 2.0 g/kg) were 
      administrated via oral gavage to db/db mice and their controls for 4 weeks. TKFS 
      significantly lowered hyperglycemia and ameliorated insulin resistance (IR) in 
      db/db mice, indicated by results from multiple tests, including fasting blood 
      glucose test, intraperitoneal insulin and glucose tolerance tests, fasting serum 
      insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment of IR analysis as well as 
      histology of pancreas islets. TKFS also decreased concentrations of serum 
      triglyceride, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, even though it did 
      not change the mouse body weights. Results from western blot and 
      immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that TKFS reversed the down-regulation of 
      p-Akt and p-AMPK, and increased the translocation of Glucose transporter type 4 
      in skeletal muscles of db/db mice. In all, TKFS had promising benefits in 
      maintaining the glucose homeostasis and reducing IR. The underlying molecular 
      mechanisms are related to promote Akt and AMPK activation and Glucose transporter 
      type 4 translocation in skeletal muscles. Our work showed that multicomponent 
      Tibetan medicine TKFS acted synergistically on multiple molecular targets and 
      signaling pathways to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Offspring of obese mothers suffer higher risks of type 2 diabetes due to 
      increased adiposity and decreased β cell function. To date, the sex-differences 
      in offspring islet insulin secretion during early life has not been evaluated 
      extensively, particularly prior to weaning at postnatal day 21 (P21). To 
      determine the role of maternal obesity on offspring islet insulin secretion, 
      C57BL/6J female dams were fed chow or western diet from 4 weeks prior to mating 
      to induce maternal obesity. First, offspring of chow-fed and obese dams were 
      evaluated on postnatal day 21 (P21) prior to weaning for body composition, 
      glucose and insulin tolerance, and islet phasic insulin-secretion. Compared to 
      same-sex controls, both male and female P21 offspring born to obese dams (MatOb) 
      had higher body adiposity and exhibited sex-specific differences in glucose 
      tolerance and insulin secretion. The male MatOb offspring developed the highest 
      extent of glucose intolerance and lowest glucose-induced insulin secretion. In 
      contrast, P21 female offspring of obese dams had unimpaired insulin secretion. 
      Using SAX-HPLC, we found that male MatOb had a decrease in pancreatic heparan 
      sulfate glycosaminoglycan, which is a macromolecule critical for islet health. 
      Notably, 8-weeks-old offspring of obese dams continued to exhibit a similar 
      pattern of sex-differences in glucose intolerance and decreased islet insulin 
      secretion. Overall, our study suggests that maternal obesity induces sex-specific 
      changes to pancreatic HSG in offspring and a lasting effect on offspring insulin 
      secretion, leading to the sex-differences in glucose intolerance.

AB  - Hawthorn polyphenol extract (HPE) is beneficial for patients with type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D). However, the mechanism underlying its beneficial effects remains unclear. 
      We investigated the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of HPE on insulin 
      resistance, inflammation, and aortic injury in T2D rats, using metformin (MF) as 
      a positive control. High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray 
      ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to determine the 
      primary polyphenols in HPE. Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining was used to 
      evaluate pathological conditions of the skeletal muscle, liver, and aorta vessels 
      in each group. The levels of serum and intestinal tissue oxidative stress, tumor 
      necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also 
      assessed. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression levels in the 
      associated molecular pathway. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from colon 
      contents were determined using headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility 
      chromatography. Our results showed that supplementation with 300 mg HPE/kg body 
      weight over four weeks significantly improved total cholesterol (TC), total 
      triglyceride (TG), insulin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in diabetic rats 
      (p < 0.01). The lesions of skeletal muscle, liver, and aorta in diabetic rats 
      were significantly improved. HPE supplementation also significantly downregulated 
      the inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1) in the liver of diabetic rats 
      via the SIRT1/AMPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, HPE significantly 
      reduced insulin resistance in T2D rats by upregulating the phosphorylation of 
      glucose absorption protein (GLUT4) and insulin resistance-associated proteins, 
      p-IRS1, p-AKT, and p-PI3K, in the rat liver (p < 0.01). The findings show that 
      HPE could also alleviate aortic injury by activating SIRT1 and regulating the 
      NF-κB and Wnt2/β-catenin signaling pathways. Overall, the results of this study 
      suggest that both HPE and MF have similar inhibitory effects on T2D in rats and 
      that HPE could be used as a functional food component in the adjuvant treatment 
      of T2D.

TI  - Spermine Protects Cardiomyocytes from High Glucose-Induced Energy Disturbance by 
      Targeting the CaSR-gp78-Ubiquitin Proteasome System.
PG  - 73-85

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the mediation of spermine on energy metabolism disorder and 
      diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) development as well as the underlying mechanisms. 
      METHODS: An in vitro model of DCM was established by incubating primary cultured 
      neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with high glucose (HG). Spermine content was assessed 
      by RP-HPLC. The protein levels were detected by western blot. Mitochondrial 
      functions were analyzed using the respiratory chain complex assay kit and 
      immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: The endogenous content of spermine was 
      decreased in the HG group, and the protein levels of ornithine decarboxylase, 
      respiratory chain complex (I-V), mitochondrial fusion-related protein (Mfn1, 
      Mfn2), Cx43, N-cadherin, CaSR, and β-catenin (in cytomembrane) were also 
      down-regulated by HG. In contrast, the protein levels of 
      spermine-N1-acetyltransferase, gp78, Fis1, Drp1, and β-catenin were up-regulated 
      by HG. Meanwhile, we observed that HG increased ubiquitination levels of Mfn1, 
      Mfn2, and Cx43, decreased membrane potential (ΔΨm), and the opening of 
      mitochondrial permeability transport pore (mPTP) followed by intracellular ATP 
      leakage. The supplement of spermine or siRNA-mediated knockdown of gp78 
      significantly alleviated the detrimental effects of HG, while downregulation of 
      CaSR aggravated the development of DCM. We further confirmed that the lower level 
      of spermine by HG activates the gp78-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via 
      downregulation of CaSR protein level, which in turn damages mitochondrial gap 
      junction intercellular communication and leads to reduced ATP level. CONCLUSION: 
      The protective role of spermine on energy metabolism disorder is based on higher 
      CaSR protein level and lower gp78 activation, pointing to the possibility that 
      spermine can be a target for the prevention and treatment of DCM.

AB  - Introduction: Human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF) is a highly valuable 
      multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in various biological 
      processes. In this study, we aim to accomplish the scaling-up production of 
      mature hbFGF (146aa) by implementing a high cell-density fermentation and 
      purification process on a 500-L scale, thereby satisfying the escalating demands 
      for both experimental research and clinical applications. Methods: The hbFGF DNA 
      fragment was cloned into a mpET-3c vector containing a kanamycin resistance gene 
      and then inserted into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) plysS strain. To optimize the 
      yield of hbFGF protein, various fermentation parameters were systematically 
      optimized using BOX-Behnken design and further validated in large-scale 
      fermentation (500-L). Additionally, a three-step purification protocol involving 
      CM-Sepharose, heparin affinity, and SP-Sepharose column chromatography was 
      developed to separate and purify the hbFGF protein. Isoelectric focusing 
      electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF/MS analysis, amino acid sequencing, CD spectroscopy, 
      and Western blotting were performed to authenticate its identity. The biological 
      efficacy of purified hbFGF was evaluated using an MTT assay as well as in a 
      diabetic deep second-degree scald model. Results: The engineered strain was 
      successfully constructed, exhibiting high expression of hbFGF and excellent 
      stability. Under the optimized fermentation conditions, an impressive bacterial 
      yield of 46.8 ± 0.3 g/L culture with an expression level of hbFGF reaching 28.2% 
      ± 0.2% was achieved in 500-L scale fermentation. Subsequently, during pilot-scale 
      purification, the final yield of purified hbFGF protein was 114.6 ± 5.9 mg/L 
      culture with RP-HPLC, SEC-HPLC, and SDS-PAGE purity exceeding 98%. The properties 
      of purified hbFGF including its molecular weight, isoelectric point (pI), amino 
      sequence, and secondary structure were found to be consistent with theoretical 
      values. Furthermore, the purified hbFGF exhibited potent mitogenic activity with 
      a specific value of 1.05 ± 0.94 × 106 AU/mg and significantly enhanced wound 
      healing in a deep second-degree scald wound diabetic rat model. Conclusion: This 
      study successfully established a stable and efficient large-scale production 
      process of hbFGF, providing a solid foundation for future industrial production.

TI  - The transmembrane transport of metformin by osteoblasts from rat mandible.
PG  - 951-62
LID - 10.1016/j.archoralbio.2009.07.010 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that metformin, one of systemic 
      antihyperglycemic drugs, can slow bone loss caused by diabetes mellitus and has 
      an osteogenic action on osteoblasts in vitro. It is tempting to speculate that 
      metformin would be transported into bone tissues around dental implant by topical 
      administration to improve the bone-implant contact in diabetic patients. In this 
      study, the osteoblasts from rat mandible were cultured with 5.5 mM (control) or 
      16.5 mM d-glucose, then the uptake of metformin by osteoblasts was detected with 
      high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Rat organic cation transporter 
      (rOct) expression was characterized by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and Western 
      blotting. It was found that, the uptake of metformin was saturable, 
      Na(+)-dependent, affected by extracellular pH and inhibited by both phenformin 
      and cimetidine (an inhibitor of Octs). rOct1 but no rOct2 was expressed 
      extensively in osteoblasts and the protein level of rOct1 could be up-regulated 
      by metformin. The uptake of metformin and phosphorylated-rOct1 at hyperglycaemic 
      cell culture (16.5 mM d-glucose) significantly increased versus 5.5 mM control (p 
      < 0.05). In conclusion, rat osteoblasts have the ability to transport the 
      metformin intra-cellularly, the uptake of metformin by osteoblasts is a secondary 
      active transportation mediated by rOct1 and high-glucose can improve the uptake 
      of metformin by osteoblasts through phosphorylation of rOct1. The current results 
      suggest that metformin could be used for dental implant topically in type 2 
      diabetic patients to increase the bone formation, therefore, to enhance the 
      success rate of dental implants clinically.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is associated with gut microbiota disturbance and 
      intestinal mucosal injuries. This study investigated the influence of propolis on 
      the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa in rats with diabetes. METHODS: 
      Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to the control group, model 
      group, and three propolis groups (supplemented with 80, 160, and 240 mg/kg·bw 
      propolis, respectively). A high-fat diet combined with a streptozotocin (STZ) 
      abdominal injection were used to induce diabetes in the rats. After 4 weeks, the 
      intestinal histopathological analysis of the ileum was observed by transmission 
      electron microscopy. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), plasma insulin, glucose 
      tolerance (OGTT) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured. The 
      expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the ileum was measured using 
      western blotting. The molecular ecology of the fecal gut microbiota was analyzed 
      by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The contents of the short-chain fatty 
      acids (SCFAs) in feces were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC). RESULTS: After propolis treatment, compared to the model group, FBG and 
      HbA1c levels declined, while the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity index 
      (ISI) increased. The levels of TJ proteins in the ileum increased in the propolis 
      groups. The tight junctions and gap junctions of the intestinal epithelium were 
      also improved in the propolis groups. The contents of the feces acetic acid, 
      propionic acid and butyrate were increased in the propolis groups. 16S rDNA 
      high-throughput sequencing revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota of 
      rats in the propolis supplement group was significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Compared to the model group, propolis exerted hypoglycemic effects in diabetic 
      rats, and it repaired intestinal mucosal damage, benefited the communities of the 
      gut microbiota and increased SCFA levels in diabetic rats.

TI  - Skin collagen fluorophore LW-1 versus skin fluorescence as markers for the 
      long-term progression of subclinical macrovascular disease in type 1 diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin collagen Long Wavelength Fluorescence (LWF) is widely used as a 
      surrogate marker for accumulation of advanced glycation end-products. Here we 
      determined the relationship of LWF with glycemia, skin fluorescence, and the 
      progression of complications during EDIC in 216 participants from the DCCT. 
      METHODS: LW-1 and collagen-linked fluorescence (CLF) were measured by either High 
      Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection (LW-1) or 
      total fluorescence of collagenase digests (CLF) in insoluble skin collagen 
      extracted from skin biopsies obtained at the end of the DCCT (1993). Skin 
      intrinsic fluorescence (SIF) was noninvasively measured on volar forearm skin at 
      EDIC year 16 by the SCOUT DS instrument. RESULTS: LW-1 levels significantly 
      increased with age and diabetes duration (P < 0.0001) and significantly decreased 
      by intensive vs. conventional glycemic therapy in both the primary (P < 0.0001) 
      and secondary (P < 0.037) DCCT cohorts. Levels were associated with 13-16 year 
      progression risk of retinopathy (>3 sustained microaneurysms, P = 0.0004) and 
      albumin excretion rate (P = 0.0038), the latter despite adjustment for HbA1c. 
      Comparative analysis for all three fluorescent measures for future risk of 
      subclinical macrovascular disease revealed the following significant (P < 0.05) 
      associations after adjusting for age, diabetes duration and HbA1c: coronary 
      artery calcium with SIF and CLF; intima-media thickness with SIF and LW-1; and 
      left ventricular mass with LW-1 and CLF. CONCLUSIONS: LW-1 is a novel risk marker 
      that is robustly and independently associated with the future progression of 
      microvascular disease, intima-media thickness and left ventricular mass in type 1 
      diabetes. Trial registration NCT00360815 and NCT00360893 at clinicaltrials.gov.

TI  - Hypoglycemic and Hypolipidemic Effects of Malonyl Ginsenosides from American 
      Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) on Type 2 Diabetic Mice.
PG  - 33652-33664
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c04656 [doi]
AB  - American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is popularly consumed as traditional 
      herbal medicine and health food for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM). Malonyl ginsenosides (MGR) are the main natural ginsenosides in American 
      ginseng. However, whether the malonyl ginsenosides in P. quinquefolius (PQ-MGR) 
      possess antidiabetic effects has not been explored yet. In this study, the 
      antidiabetic effects and the underlying mechanism of PQ-MGR in high-fat 
      diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced T2DM mice were investigated. The chemical 
      composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray 
      ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Our results showed that 14 
      malonyl ginsenosides were identified in the PQ-MGR. Among them, the content of 
      m-Rb(1) represented about 77.4% of the total malonyl ginsenosides. After a 5-week 
      experiment, the PQ-MGR significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG), 
      triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (LDL-C), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), alanine transaminase (ALT), and 
      aspartate transaminase (AST) levels and improved glucose tolerance and insulin 
      resistance. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein 
      expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-AMPK, p-ACC, PPAR(γ), and GLUT4 in the liver and 
      skeletal muscle were significantly upregulated after PQ-MGR treatment. In 
      contrast, the protein expressions of p-IRS1 and p-JNK were significantly 
      downregulated. Our results revealed that PQ-MGR could ameliorate glucose and 
      lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in T2DM via regulation of the insulin 
      receptor substrate-1/phosphoinositide3-kinase/protein-kinase B (IRS1/PI3K/Akt) 
      and AMP-activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) pathways. 
      These findings suggest that PQ-MGR may be used as an antidiabetic candidate drug 
      for T2DM treatment.

TI  - Protectin DX ameliorates palmitate-induced hepatic insulin resistance through 
      AMPK/SIRT1-mediated modulation of fetuin-A and SeP expression.
PG  - 898-909
LID - 10.1111/1440-1681.13131 [doi]
AB  - The role as well as the molecular mechanisms of protectin DX (PDX) in the 
      prevention of hepatic insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, remains 
      unknown. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the direct impact 
      of PDX on insulin resistance and to investigate the expression of fetuin-A and 
      selenoprotein P (SeP), hepatokines that are involved in insulin signalling, in 
      hepatocytes. Human serum levels of PDX as well as fetuin-A and SeP were 
      determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Human primary 
      hepatocytes were treated with palmitate and PDX. NF-κB phosphorylation as well as 
      expression of insulin signalling associated genes and hepatokines were determined 
      by Western blotting analysis. FOXO1 binding levels were measured by quantitative 
      real-time PCR. Selected genes from candidate pathways were evaluated by small 
      interfering (si) RNA-mediated gene suppression. Serum PDX levels were 
      significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated, whereas serum fetuin-A and SeP levels 
      were increased (P < 0.05) in obese subjects compared with healthy subjects. In in 
      vitro experiments, PDX treatment increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
      phosphorylation and SIRT1 expression and attenuated palmitate-induced fetuin-A 
      and SeP expression and insulin resistance in hepatocytes. AMPK or SIRT1 siRNA 
      mitigated the suppressive effects of PDX on palmitate-induced fetuin-A through 
      NF-κB and SeP expression linked to FOXO1 and insulin resistance. Recombinant 
      fetuin-A and SeP reversed the suppressive effects of fetuin-A and SeP expression 
      on palmitate-mediated impairment of insulin signalling. The current finding 
      provides novel insight into the underlying mechanism linking hepatokines to the 
      pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mouse models possessing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and/or human 
      aldose reductase (hAR) in vascular tissues have been established and crossed with 
      naturally diabetic Akita mice to produce new diabetic mouse models. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Colonies of transgenic C57BL mice expressing GFP (SMAA-GFP), 
      hAR (SMAA-hAR) or both (SMAA-GFP-hAR) in vascular tissues expressing smooth 
      muscle actin were established and crossbred with C57BL/6-Ins2(Akita)/J (AK) mice 
      to produce naturally diabetic offspring AK-SMAA-GFP and AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR. Aldose 
      reductase inhibitor AL1576 (ARI) was administered in chow. Retinal and lenticular 
      sorbitol levels were determined by HPLC. Retinal functions were evaluated by 
      electroretinography (ERGs). Growth factor and signaling changes were determined 
      by Western Blots using commercially available antibodies. Retinal vasculatures 
      were isolated from the neural retina by enzymatic digestion. Flat mounts were 
      stained with PAS-hematoxylin and analyzed. RESULTS: Akita transgenics developed 
      DM by 8 weeks of age with blood glucose levels higher in males than females. 
      Sorbitol levels were higher in neural retinas of AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR compared to 
      AK-SMAA-GFP mice. AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR mice also had higher VEGF levels and reduced 
      ERG scotopic b-wave function, both of which were normalized by AL1576. 
      AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR mice showed induction of the retinal growth factors bFGF, IGF-1, 
      and TGFβ, as well as signaling changes in P-Akt, P-SAPK/JNK and P-44/42 MAPK that 
      were also reduced by ARI treatment. Quantitative analysis of flat mounts in 18 
      week AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR mice revealed increased loss of nuclei/capillary length and 
      a significant increase in the percentage of acellular capillaries present which 
      was not seen in AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR treated with ARI. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These 
      new mouse models of early onset diabetes may be valuable tools for assessing both 
      the role of hyperglycemia and AR in the development of retinal lesions associated 
      with diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic status worldwide. 
      Wild lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) is a plant of the North 
      American Aboriginal traditional pharmacopeia with antidiabetic potential, 
      especially when it is fermented with Serratia vaccinii. METHODS: A phytochemical 
      fractionation scheme was used to identify potential bioactive compounds as 
      confirmed by HPLC retention times and UV-Vis spectra. 3 T3-L1 cells were 
      differentiated for 7 days with either Normal Blueberry Extract (NBE), Fermented 
      Blueberry Extract (FBE/F1), seven fractions and four pure compounds. Triglyceride 
      content was measured. Examination of selected intracellular signalling components 
      (p-Akt, p-AMPK) and transcriptional factors (SREBP-1c and PPARγ) was carried out 
      by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect of FBE/F1 on adipocyte 
      triglyceride accumulation was attributed to total phenolic (F2) and chlorogenic 
      acid enriched (F3-2) fractions that both inhibited by 75%. Pure compounds 
      catechol (CAT) and chlorogenic acid (CA) also inhibited adipogenesis by 70%. 
      Treatment with NBE, F1, F3-2, CAT and CA decreased p-AKT, whereas p-AMPK tended 
      to increase with F1. The expression of SREBP1-c was not significantly modulated. 
      In contrast, PPARγ decreased in all experimental groups that inhibited 
      adipogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that fermented blueberry 
      extract contains compounds with anti-adipogenic activity, which can serve to 
      standardize nutraceutical preparations from fermented blueberry juice and to 
      develop novel compounds with anti-obesity properties.

PG  - 1766-73
AB  - Pentosidine is a fluorescent protein cross-link and glycoxidation marker for the 
      advanced glycation reaction in diabetes, aging, and uremia. We raised polyclonal 
      antibodies in New Zealand White rabbits against this hapten coupled to keyhole 
      limpet hemocyanin. The antibodies detected by ELISA reacted strongly with free 
      pentosidine but not with pentosidine-like compounds. The working range of the 
      competitive ELISA for standard pentosidine was 0.1-100 pmol. Pentosidine was 
      detectable in bovine serum albumin incubated with ribose as a function of 
      incubation time. Immunoblotting studies showed that pentosidine specifically 
      stained in oligomers of lysozyme incubated with ribose. Digestion with protease 
      (Pronase E, 20 g/kg) as well as acid hydrolysis enhanced the immunoreactivity of 
      samples, the pentosidine values in digested human plasma correlating with those 
      measured by HPLC (r = 0.98). Pentosidine in diabetic and uremic plasma digested 
      with Pronase E was significantly higher than normal (P < 0.01; mean +/- SD): 1620 
      +/- 1940 and 2630 +/- 1320 [corrected] nmol/L, respectively, vs 151 +/- 55 nmol/L 
      (normal). Amounts of pentosidine in hydrolyzed skin collagen increased with age 
      and were increased in diabetes and uremia. This ELISA provides a new tool for 
      assessing the role of the advanced Maillard reaction in aging and age-related 
      diseases.

TI  - Methylglyoxal scavengers attenuate endothelial dysfunction induced by 
      methylglyoxal and high concentrations of glucose.
PG  - 1843-56
LID - 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01017.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of hypertension and 
      diabetes. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive dicarbonyl metabolite of glucose and 
      its levels are elevated in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in diabetic 
      patients. We investigated if MG induces endothelial dysfunction and whether MG 
      scavengers can prevent endothelial dysfunction induced by MG and high glucose 
      concentrations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Endothelium-dependent relaxation was 
      studied in aortic rings from Sprague-Dawley rats. We also used cultured rat 
      aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The MG was measured by HPLC 
      and Western blotting and assay kits were used. KEY RESULTS: Incubation of aortic 
      rings with MG (30 µM) or high glucose (25 mM) attenuated endothelium-dependent, 
      acetylcholine-induced relaxation, which was restored by two different MG 
      scavengers, aminoguanidine (100 µM) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (600 µM). 
      Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with MG or high glucose increased 
      cellular MG levels, effects prevented by aminoguanidine and NAC. In cultured 
      endothelial cells, MG and high glucose reduced basal and bradykinin-stimulated 
      nitric oxide (NO) production, cGMP levels, and serine-1177 phosphorylation and 
      activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), without affecting threonine-495 and 
      Akt phosphorylation or total eNOS protein. These effects of MG and high glucose 
      were attenuated by aminoguanidine or NAC. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our 
      results show for the first time that MG reduced serine-1177 phosphorylation, 
      activity of eNOS and NO production. MG caused endothelial dysfunction similar to 
      that induced by high glucose. Specific and safe MG scavengers have potential to 
      prevent endothelial dysfunction induced by MG and high glucose concentrations.

TI  - Syringol isolated from Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn bran suppresses inflammatory 
      response through the down-regulation of cPLA(2), COX-2, IκBα, p38 and MPO 
      signaling in sPLA(2) induced mice paw oedema.
PG  - 1853-1870

AB  - Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn (E. coracana) is one of the highest consuming food 
      crops in Asia and Africa. E. coracana is a plant with several medicinal values 
      including anti-ulcerative, anti-diabetic, anti-viral and anti-cancer properties. 
      However, the anti-inflammatory property of E. coracana remains to be elucidated. 
      Therefore, the objective of present study was to investigate the potential in 
      isolated molecule from E. coracana via a combination of in vitro, in vivo and in 
      silico methods. In this study, we have isolated, purified and characterized an 
      anti-inflammatory molecule from E. coracana bran extract known as syringol. 
      Purification of syringol was accomplished by combination of GC-MS and RP-HPLC 
      techniques. Syringol significantly inhibited the enzymes activity of sPLA(2) 
      (IC(50) = 3.00 µg) and 5-LOX (IC(50) = 0.325 µg) in vitro. The inhibition is 
      independent of substrate concentration, calcium ion concentration and was 
      irreversible. Syringol interacts with purified sPLA(2) enzymes as evidenced by 
      fluorescence and molecular docking studies. Further, the syringol molecule dose 
      dependently inhibited the development of sPLA(2) and λ-carrageenan induced edema. 
      Furthermore, syringol decreases the expression of cPLA(2), COX-2, IκBα, p38 and 
      MPO in edematous tissues as demonstrated by western blots. These studies revealed 
      that syringol isolated from E. coracana bran may develop as a potent 
      anti-inflammatory molecule.

TI  - Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge total saponins lower lipid via modulating MAOA 
      activity to enhance defense mechanisms in mice and C. elegans.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Within Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge (AAB), the 
      pivotal bioactive constituents are identified as Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge 
      total saponins (ABS). In traditional pharmacology, ABS has exhibited notable 
      anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and cardioprotective properties. Despite these 
      observed effects, the specific protective mechanisms of ABS against metabolic 
      diseases and improving the endocrine system remain largely uncharted. AIM TO 
      STUDY: This work intends to shed light on the effects and intrinsic mechanisms of 
      ABS on metabolic diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The characterization of ABS 
      components was achieved through High-Performance Liquid Chromatography/Mass 
      Spectrometry (HPLC/MS). To evaluate ABS's anti-inflammatory efficacy, mouse 
      macrophages underwent analysis using the Griess method. Induced differentiation 
      of mouse fibroblasts was assessed through Oil Red O staining. In an obesity model 
      with C57BL/6 N mice, ABS administration prompted measurements of glucose and 
      insulin tolerance. Western blot analysis quantified lipolysis and 
      anti-inflammatory protein expression. Nile red staining gauged body fat content 
      in C. elegans post-ABS treatment. The mechanism of ABS action was elucidated 
      through mRNA sequencing, further validated using RNA interference technology, and 
      nematode mutants. RESULTS: ABS showcased the ability to diminish Nitric Oxide 
      (NO) production in inflammatory macrophages and shrink adipocyte lipid droplets. 
      In mice experiments, ABS was effective in alleviating fat accumulation and 
      affecting serum lipid metabolism in diabetic mice. It enhanced oral glucose 
      tolerance and insulin tolerance while increasing lipolysis-associated protein 
      expression. ABS notably reduced fat content in C. elegans. Mechanistically, ABS 
      downregulated NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 
      (NLRP3) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) expression while enhancing UGT, ilys-2, 
      and ilys-3. Lipolysis emerged as a pivotal pathway for ABS in the therapeutic 
      intervention of metabolic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation has revealed 
      that ABS exert a role in combating metabolic diseases by enhancing the body's 
      defense mechanisms. ABS activate the NLRP3-neurotransmitter-visceral adipose 
      pathway in mice, thereby bolstering resistance and diminishing fat accumulation. 
      In C. elegans, ABS downregulated the expression of MAOA, bolstered resistance, 
      and augmented glucuronidase activity, consequently leading to a reduction in fat 
      content.

TI  - Defective Proinsulin Handling Modulates the MHC I Bound Peptidome and Activates 
      the Inflammasome in β-Cells.

AB  - How immune tolerance is lost to pancreatic β-cell peptides triggering autoimmune 
      type 1 diabetes is enigmatic. We have shown that loss of the proinsulin chaperone 
      glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 94 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to 
      mishandling of proinsulin, ER stress, and activation of the immunoproteasome. We 
      hypothesize that inadequate ER proinsulin folding capacity relative to 
      biosynthetic need may lead to an altered β-cell major histocompatibility complex 
      (MHC) class-I bound peptidome and inflammasome activation, sensitizing β-cells to 
      immune attack. We used INS-1E cells with or without GRP94 knockout (KO), or in 
      the presence or absence of GRP94 inhibitor PU-WS13 (GRP94i, 20 µM), or exposed to 
      proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β or interferon gamma (IFNγ) (15 
      pg/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively) for 24 h. RT1.A (rat MHC I) expression was 
      evaluated using flow cytometry. The total RT1.A-bound peptidome analysis was 
      performed on cell lysates fractionated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (RP-HPLC), followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem 
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, 
      leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein (NLRP1), nuclear factor 
      of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IκBα), and 
      (pro) IL-1β expression and secretion were investigated by Western blotting. GRP94 
      KO increased RT1.A expression in β-cells, as did cytokine exposure compared to 
      relevant controls. Immunopeptidome analysis showed increased RT1.A-bound peptide 
      repertoire in GRP94 KO/i cells as well as in the cells exposed to cytokines. The 
      GRP94 KO/cytokine exposure groups showed partial overlap in their peptide 
      repertoire. Notably, proinsulin-derived peptide diversity increased among the 
      total RT1.A peptidome in GRP94 KO/i along with cytokines exposure. NLRP1 
      expression was upregulated in GRP94 deficient cells along with decreased IκBα 
      content while proIL-1β cellular levels declined, coupled with increased secretion 
      of mature IL-1β. Our results suggest that limiting β-cell proinsulin chaperoning 
      enhances RT1.A expression alters the MHC-I peptidome including proinsulin 
      peptides and activates inflammatory pathways, suggesting that stress associated 
      with impeding proinsulin handling may sensitize β-cells to immune-attack.

AB  - The degree of oxidized cysteine (Cys) 34 in human serum albumin (HSA), as 
      determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is correlated with 
      oxidative stress related pathological conditions. In order to further 
      characterize the oxidation of Cys34-HSA at the molecular level and to develop a 
      suitable analytical method for a rapid and sensitive clinical laboratory 
      analysis, the use of electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer 
      (ESI-TOFMS) was evaluated. A marked increase in the cysteinylation of Cys34 
      occurs in chronic liver and kidney diseases and diabetes mellitus. A significant 
      positive correlation was observed between the Cys-Cys34-HSA fraction of plasma 
      samples obtained from 229 patients, as determined by ESI-TOFMS, and the degree of 
      oxidized Cys34-HSA determined by HPLC. The Cys-Cys34-HSA fraction was 
      significantly increased with the progression of liver cirrhosis, and was reduced 
      by branched chain amino acids (BCAA) treatment. The changes in the Cys-Cys34-HSA 
      fraction were significantly correlated with the alternations of the plasma levels 
      of advanced oxidized protein products, an oxidative stress marker for proteins. 
      The binding ability of endogenous substances (bilirubin and tryptophan) and drugs 
      (warfarin and diazepam) to HSA purified from chronic liver disease patients were 
      significantly suppressed but significantly improved by BCAA supplementation. 
      Interestingly, the changes in this physiological function of HSA in chronic liver 
      disease were correlated with the Cys-Cys34-HSA fraction. In conclusion, ESI-TOFMS 
      is a suitable high throughput method for the rapid and sensitive quantification 
      of Cys-Cys34-HSA in a large number of samples for evaluating oxidative stress 
      related chronic disease progression or in response to a treatment.

TI  - A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6, ω3) Mediated Attenuation of 
      Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male Ldlr (-/-) Mice.
LID - 10.3390/metabo9110252 [doi]
LID - 252
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem 
      worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). 
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, 
      and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of 
      these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify 
      potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical 
      mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse, Ldlr (-/-)) model to assess 
      transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid 
      (DHA, 22:6, ω3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the 
      previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled 
      with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid 
      chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to 
      assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin 
      composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and 
      monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, ω6) in membrane 
      lipids and suppressed ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids 
      and ω3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA 
      lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and 
      significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as 
      well as C(20-22) ω3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and 
      fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C(20-22) ω3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- 
      and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted 
      p-value; q ≤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial 
      remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic 
      pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic 
      anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C(20-22) ω3 PUFA.

AB  - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a serious microangiopathic 
      complication of diabetes mellitus and a major cause of blindness in working-age 
      adults. Diabetes-induced alterations in the vitreous protein composition in 
      diabetic patients with PDR may be responsible for the presence of PDR. Therefore, 
      we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis and compared the protein profiles 
      of vitreous humor from type 2 diabetic patients with PDR (n = 8) and that from 
      normal human eyes donated for corneal transplant (n = 8). Using reversed phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled to electrospray 
      Ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), we identified 96 significant 
      differentially expressed proteins (abundance ratio > 1.5, p < 0.05), including 37 
      and 59 proteins up- and downregulated in PDR vitreous compared with the control, 
      respectively. Biological pathway analysis revealed 44 proteins involved in 56 
      biological pathways; among them, the most remarkable pathways differentially 
      represented between PDR and normal vitreous were the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, 
      complement and coagulation cascades, gap junction, and phagosome pathways. The 
      differential expressions of angiopoietin-related protein 6, apolipoprotein A-I, 
      estrogen receptor alpha, and tubulin were confirmed by western blot analysis. 
      These data provide insight into the molecular events possibly involved in the 
      pathogenesis of PDR and widen the scope of potential avenues for new therapies 
      for PDR.

AB  - Jiao-Tai-Wan (JTW), a classical Chinese prescription, has been clinically 
      employed to treat diabetes mellitus in recent years. To investigate the 
      comparative evaluations on anti-diabetic effects and pharmacokinetics of the 
      active ingredient berberine in mice treated with JTW in various combinations of 
      its constituent herbs. In our study, the anti-diabetic study was carried out in 
      diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The 
      diabetic mice were randomly assigned to three therapy groups and orally 
      administered with different prescription proportions of Rhizoma Coptidis and 
      Cinnamomum cassia respectively. The level of plasma glucose, lipid profile and 
      parameters related to oxidative stress were determined. The concentrations of 
      berberine in non-diabetic mice plasma were determined using HPLC, and main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated. The results indicated that the 
      compatibility effects of ingredients present in Cinnamomum cassia could affect 
      the anti-diabetic ability and pharmacokinetics of berberine in JTW.

AB  - Three homoisoflavonoids and one dimethoxychalcone from Portulaca oleracea L. were 
      isolated using bioassay-guided fractionation and HPLC. Among the compounds 1-4, 
      (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone (compound 3) had the 
      most effect on glucose uptake in the adipocytes. We investigated how 
      (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone contributed to increase 
      glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Levels of the glucose transporters GLUT-4, 
      as well as glucose uptake, and key proteins of the insulin pathway, namely 
      PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathway are analyzed using glucose uptake assay and western 
      blot analysis. Our results show that 
      (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone significantly increased 
      glucose uptake by stimulating translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in 
      3T3-L1 adipocytes. High levels of expression of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane 
      resulted from IRS-1 phosphorylation, PI3K activation, Akt phosphorylation and 
      phosphorylation of AMPK, resulting in increased glucose uptake by the cells. The 
      increase in glucose uptake due to 
      (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone was significantly 
      inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor and the AMPK inhibitor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 
      These findings suggest that 
      (E)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-(2'-hydroxybenzyl)-4-chromanone may increase glucose 
      uptake by stimulating GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane via activating 
      the PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

      for Renal Injury in Diabetic Nephropathy-In Vivo and In Vitro Evidence for 
      Autophagy Regulation.
PG  - 732

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious complication of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) with limited treatment options. DN leads to progressive renal 
      failure and accelerates rapidly into end-stage renal disease. Astragalus 
      mongholicus Bunge and Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.H. Chen formula (APF) is a 
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula widely used to treat chronic kidney 
      diseases (CKD) in the clinic in the southwest of China. The aim of this study is 
      to explore how APF and its related TCM theory work on DN and whether 
      mTOR/PINK1/Parkin signaling plays a part in this process. METHODS: HPLC was used 
      for preliminary chemical analysis and quantitative analysis of the five 
      components of APF. An in vivo autophagy deficiency model was established in 
      C57BL/6 mice by streptozocin (STZ) combined with a high-fat and high-sugar diet, 
      while the in vitro autophagy deficiency model was induced with high glucose (HG) 
      in renal mesangial cells (RMCs). Renal histopathology staining was performed to 
      investigate the extents of inflammation and injury. Real time-PCR and Western 
      blotting techniques were utilized to assess autophagy-related proteins. RESULTS: 
      APF significantly ameliorated renal injury in DN mice, specifically restoring 
      blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and 24-hour albuminuria. APF also reduced 
      the mRNA and protein expressions of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in STZ-induced DN mice. 
      Furthermore, APF improved the autophagy deficiency induced by STZ in vivo or HG 
      in vitro, as revealed by changes in the expressions of mTOR, PINK1, Parkin, 
      Beclin 1, p62, and LC3B. Notably, inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine in 
      APF-treated RMCs aggravated cellular damage and altered mTOR/PINK1/Parkin 
      signaling, indicating that APF rescued HG damage through promoting autophagy. 
      CONCLUSION: APF may protect the kidneys from inflammation injuries in DN by 
      upregulating autophagy via suppressing mTOR and activating PINK1/Parkin 
      signaling. This experimental evidence strongly supports APF as a potential option 
      for the prevention and treatment of DN.

TI  - Sparassis crispa exerts anti-inflammatory activity via suppression of 
      TLR-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophage 
      cells.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Sparassis crispa, also known as cauliflower 
      mushroom, has been used historically in traditional Asian medicine. It possesses 
      various biological activities, such as immunopotentiation, anti-diabetes, 
      anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory effects. Recently, we isolated the non-aqueous 
      fraction from methanol extract of S. crispa (SCF4) by using water-organic solvent 
      mixtures and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the present study, 
      we identified the anti-inflammatory activity and action mechanism of SCF4 in 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: The chloroform layer isolated from S. crispa methanol extract was 
      separated into seven fractions using preparative HPLC. The fractions were then 
      applied to NO assay to identify the fraction with the best anti-inflammatory 
      activity. The inflammation inhibitory effect and underlying mechanism of SCF4 in 
      LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells were assessed using WST-1 assay, enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ROS assay, and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: SCF4 
      significantly suppressed LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators, 
      such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)- 6, and 
      IL-1β, without cytotoxicity. In addition, SCF4 downregulated not only the 
      expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 
      (COX-2), but also the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and 
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) stimulated by LPS. SCF4 also blocked 
      the nuclear translocation of NF-κB via reduction of inhibitor of κB alpha (IκBα) 
      degradation. Furthermore, SCF4 inhibited the phosphorylation of transforming 
      growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), an important upstream factor of 
      NF-κB and MAPK signaling mediated through toll-like receptor (TLR). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings demonstrate for the first time the correlation between the 
      anti-inflammatory activity of SCF4 and TLR-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling 
      pathways in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells, suggesting that the 
      non-aqueous extract of S. crispa could be applied as a promising natural product 
      for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Quercetin-Rich Guava (Psidium guajava) Juice in Combination with Trehalose 
      Reduces Autophagy, Apoptosis and Pyroptosis Formation in the Kidney and Pancreas 
      of Type II Diabetic Rats.

AB  - We explored whether the combination of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory guava 
      (Psidium guajava) and trehalose treatment protects the kidney and pancreas 
      against Type II diabetes (T2DM)-induced injury in rats. We measured the active 
      component of guava juice by HPLC analysis. T2DM was induced in Wistar rats by 
      intraperitoneal administration of nicotinamide and streptozotocin and combination 
      with high fructose diets for 8 weeks. The rats fed with different dosages of 
      guava juice in combination with or without trehalose for 4 weeks were evaluated 
      the parameters including OGTT, plasma insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR (insulin 
      resistance) and HOMA-β (β cell function and insulin secretion). We measured 
      oxidative and inflammatory degrees by immunohistochemistry stain, fluorescent 
      stain, and western blot and serum and kidney reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a 
      chemiluminescence analyzer. High content of quercetin in the guava juice 
      scavenged H2O2 and HOCl, whereas trehalose selectively reduced H2O2, not HOCl. 
      T2DM affected the levels in OGTT, plasma insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and HOMA-β, 
      whereas these T2DM-altered parameters, except HbA1c, were significantly improved 
      by guava and trehalose treatment. The levels of T2DM-enhanced renal ROS, 
      4-hydroxynonenal, caspase-3/apoptosis, LC3-B/autophagy and IL-1β/pyroptosis were 
      significantly decreased by guava juice and trehalose. The combination with 
      trehalose and guava juice protects the pancreas and kidney against T2DM-induced 
      injury.

TI  - Buxuhuayu decoction accelerates angiogenesis by activating the PI3K-Akt-eNOS 
      signalling pathway in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic ulcer rat model.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Buxuhuayu decoction (BXHYD) has been frequently 
      used to treat patients with diabetic ulcers (DUs), without notable adverse 
      reactions. However, the related molecular mechanism remains unelucidated. AIM OF 
      THE STUDY: This study assessed the potential mechanism of BXHYD against DUs by 
      using network pharmacology and animal experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for quality control of 
      BXHYD. Further, the hub compounds and targets were screened from the Active 
      Compound-Targets (ACT) network and the protein and protein interaction (PPI) 
      network. Enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID, and molecular docking 
      technology was used to identify active compounds that may play a key role in pub 
      targets. Finally, a DUs animal model was established and used to elucidate the 
      effect of BXHYD on the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signalling pathway. RESULTS: (1) 
      Calycosin-7-glucoside, amygdalin, and tanshinone iiA were detected in the 
      freeze-dried powder of BXHYD. (2) Twelve hub compounds and eight hub targets were 
      screened using the ACT and PPI networks. Through molecular docking, it was found 
      that the four hub targets (TP53, IL6, VEGFA, and AKT1) binds luteolin and 
      quercetin more tightly. (3) BXHYD is most likely to promote angiogenesis and 
      wound healing by activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signalling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This research revealed that BXHYD might activate the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signalling 
      pathway to promote DUs healing. These findings support the clinical use of BXHYD 
      and provide the foundation for its subsequent studies.

TI  - Lactobacillus johnsonii inhibits indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and alters 
      tryptophan metabolite levels in BioBreeding rats.
PG  - 1711-20
LID - 10.1096/fj.12-223339 [doi]
AB  - In our previous work, we found that feeding Lactobacillus johnsonii to 
      BioBreeding diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats decreased the incidence of diabetes 
      development. The aim of this study was to investigate host pathways affected by 
      L. johnsonii, with specific focus on the rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan 
      catabolism, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Suspensions of L. johnsonii or an 
      equal volume of vehicle were orally administered to BBDP rats. Tissue IDO was 
      investigated using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, whereas tryptophan, 
      kynurenine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations were quantified by HPLC 
      and ELISA. IDO activity was also investigated using L. johnsonii culture 
      cell-free supernatant (CFS) with affinity-purified IDO and HT-29 intestinal 
      epithelial cells. L. johnsonii feeding resulted in a 17% reduction in serum 
      kynurenine compared with that in vehicle-fed controls, correlating with a 
      1.4-fold elevation in 5-HT levels. H₂O₂ produced by L. johnsonii abolished IDO 
      activity in vitro, and L. johnsonii feeding resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in 
      ileum lumen H₂O₂. L. johnsonii CFS significantly reduced IDO activity in HT-29 
      intestinal epithelial cells (47% reduction) compared with that in vehicle-treated 
      controls, an effect abolished by catalase treatment. These data support the role 
      of H₂O₂ in commensal bacteria-host interactions and highlight the influence of 
      commensal bacteria-derived H₂O₂ on host physiology.

TI  - Sustained Stimulation of β(2)AR Inhibits Insulin Signaling in H9C2 Cardiomyoblast 
      Cells Through the PKA-Dependent Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 3887-3898
LID - 10.2147/DMSO.S268028 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate the role of β(2) adrenergic 
      receptor (β(2)AR) in insulin signaling transduction in H9C2 cardiomyoblast cells 
      to understand the formation of the β(2)AR-insulin receptor (IR) protein complex 
      and its role in insulin-induced Glut4 expression. METHODS: H9C2 cells were 
      treated with various protein inhibitors (CGP, β(1)AR inhibitor CGP20712; ICI, 
      β(2)AR inhibitor ICI 118,551; PKI, PKA inhibitor myristoylated PKI; PD 0325901, 
      MEK inhibitor; SP600125, JNK inhibitor) with or without insulin or isoproterenol 
      (ISO) before RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR). Yeast 
      two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation and His-tag pull-down assay were carried out 
      to investigate the formation of the β(2)AR-IR protein complex. The intracellular 
      concentrations of cAMP in H9C2 cells were tested by high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) and the phosphorylation of JNK was tested by Western blot. 
      RESULTS: Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the most significantly 
      enriched processes in the domain of molecular function (MF) were catalytic 
      activity and binding, whereas in the domain of biological processes (BP) were 
      metabolic process and cellular process. Furthermore, the enriched processes in 
      the domain of cellular components (CC) were cell and cell parts. The Kyoto 
      encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the most 
      significant pathways that have been altered included the PI3K-Akt and MAPK 
      signaling pathways. Q-PCR, which was performed to verify the gene expression 
      levels exhibited consistent results. In evaluating the signaling pathways, the 
      sustained stimulation of β(2)AR by ISO inhibited insulin signalling, and the 
      effect was primarily through the cAMP-PKA-JNK pathway and MEK/JNK signaling 
      pathway. Yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation and His-tag pull-down assay 
      revealed that β(2)AR, IR, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), Grb2-associated 
      binding protein 1 (GAB1) and Grb2 existed in the same protein complex. 
      CONCLUSION: The sustained stimulation of β(2)AR might inhibit insulin signaling 
      transduction through the cAMP-PKA-JNK and MEK/JNK pathways in H9C2 cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glomerular injury is a prominent pathological feature of diabetic 
      kidney disease (DKD). Constitutively active NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is a major 
      source of reactive oxygen species that mediates hyperglycemia-induced mesangial 
      cell (MC) fibrotic injury. However, the mechanism that Nox4 utilizes to achieve 
      its biological outcome remains elusive, and the signaling pathways that regulate 
      this isoform oxidase are not well understood. Here, our goal is to study the 
      detailed mechanism by which NAPDH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is post-transcriptionally 
      regulated in MC during diabetic pathology. METHODS: We studied the protein 
      expression of HuR, Nox4 and matrix proteins by western blotting, while we 
      assessed the mRNA stability of Nox4 by RT-PCR and polysomal assay, examined 
      in vitro cultured glomerular mesangial cells treated by high glucose (HG) and 
      diabetic animal induced by STZ. The binding assay between HuR and the Nox4 
      promoter was done by immuno-precipiating with HuR antibody and detecting the 
      presence of Nox4 mRNA, or by pull-down by using biotinlyated labeled Nox4 
      promoter RNA and detecting the presence of the HuR protein. The binding was also 
      confirmed in MCs where Nox4 promoter-containing luciferage constructs were 
      transfected. ROS levels were measured with DHE/DCF dyes in cells, or lucigenin 
      chemiluminescence for Nox enzymatic levels, or HPLC assay for superoxide. HuR 
      protein was inhibited by antisense oligo that utilized osmotic pumps for 
      continuous delivery in animal models. The H1bAc1 ratio was measured by an ELISA 
      kit for mice. RESULTS: We demonstrate that in MCs, high glucose (HG) elicits a 
      rapid upregulation of Nox4 protein via translational mechanisms. Nox4 mRNA 3' 
      untranslated region (3'-UTR) contains numerous AU-rich elements (AREs) that are 
      potential binding sites for the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR). We 
      show that HG promotes HuR activation/expression and that HuR is required for 
      HG-induced Nox4 protein expression/mRNA translation, ROS generation, and 
      subsequent MC fibrotic injury. Through a series of invitro RNA-binding assays, we 
      demonstrate that HuR acts via binding to AREs in Nox4 3'-UTR in response to HG. 
      The invivo relevance of these observations is confirmed by the findings that 
      increased Nox4 is accompanied by the binding of HuR to Nox4 mRNA in kidneys from 
      type 1 diabetic animals, and further suppressing HuR expression showed a 
      reno-protective role in a type 1 diabetic mouse model via reducing MC injury, 
      along with the improvement of hyperglycemia and renal function. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      established for the first time that HuR-mediated translational regulation of Nox4 
      contributes to the pathogenesis of fibrosis of the glomerular microvascular bed. 
      Thus therapeutic interventions affecting the interplay between Nox4 and HuR could 
      be exploited as valuable tools in designing treatments for DKD.

TI  - Research on the wound healing effect of Shengji Huayu Formula ethanol 
      extract-derived fractions in streptozotocin-induced diabetic ulcer rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic ulcer is a common complication of diabetes. It is 
      characterized by a long-term disease course and high recurrence rate. Shengji 
      Huayu Formula (SHF) is an effective formula for treating diabetic ulcers. 
      However, the specific effective parts of SHF remain unclear. Clarifying the 
      active polar site of SHF would be helpful to refine research on the components in 
      SHF that promote wound healing. This research aims to focus on evaluating the 
      activity of polar fractions. METHODS: A diabetic rat model was established by 
      intraperitoneally injecting streptozotocin (STZ) and was adopted to confirm the 
      therapeutic effect of SHF. Four different polarity parts were extracted from SHF 
      and prepared into a cream to evaluate the activity. High-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) was used to detect chemical constituents in chloroform 
      extracts. RESULTS: It was discovered that dracorhodin, aloe-emodin, rhein, 
      imperatorin, emodin, isoimperatorin, chrysophanol, physcion, and tanshinone IIA 
      were the main components of the chloroform extract from SHF. The results revealed 
      that chloroform extract could effectively accelerate diabetic wound healing by 
      promoting collagen regeneration and epidermal repair. Chloroform extract of SHF 
      could stimulate the generation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The 
      results are also indicated that the effective active fraction was the chloroform 
      part, and the method of detecting the main chemical constituents in the active 
      part was successfully established. CONCLUSION: SHF could improve diabetic ulcers 
      by promoting granulation tissue synthesis. In this study, four polar parts 
      (petroleum ether, chloroform, ethylacetate, n-butanol) were extracted from a 95% 
      ethanol extract. In contrast, chloroform polar parts showed a higher wound 
      closure rate, stimulated more collagen regeneration and promoted more production 
      of vascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, the chloroform extract of SHF was 
      the effective polar part in ameliorating diabetic wound healing.

AB  - Collagen undergoes progressive browning with aging and diabetes characterized by 
      yellowing, fluorescence and crosslinking, the cause of which remains 
      unelucidated. As an initial step towards understanding the mechanism(s) of 
      insolubilization of collagen in aging, the major fluorophores/chromophores from 
      the insoluble fraction of human dura mater were isolated and their spectroscopic 
      properties were characterized. High molecular weight tryptic peptides of 
      insoluble collagen were cleaved by sequential enzymatic digestion followed by 
      separation into high (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) fractions by gel 
      filtration chromatography. LMW was further separated by paper and reverse phase 
      chromatography (HPLC). Two fluorescent peaks, nicknamed P and M, were obtained 
      from LMW which had UV maxima at 325 and 350 nm and excitation/fluorescence maxima 
      at 335/385 and 360/460 nm, respectively. Fluorophore M was borohydride reducible 
      and unstable to acid-hydrolysis, while P remained unaffected. Large quantities of 
      fluorophore M and pyridinoline were found in the highly crosslinked HMW fraction 
      remaining following exhaustive proteolytic digestion. Fluorophore P and M were 
      the major fluorophores recovered from the tryptic digest of insoluble dura mater. 
      Fluorescence spectra of M suggest an iminopropene type of configuration which 
      could result from nonenzymatic browning of collagen with, e.g., glucose or 
      malonyldialdehyde, as a result of lipid peroxidation. Spectroscopic and chemical 
      properties of fluorophore P were reminiscent but not identical with those of 
      pyridinium crosslinks. Structure elucidation of these fluorophores is expected to 
      provide important insight into the aging processes of the extracellular matrix.

TI  - Advanced glycation end-products induce cell cycle arrest and hypertrophy in 
      podocytes.
PG  - 2179-91
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Podocyte injury with loss of cells into the urine seems to be an 
      early factor in diabetic nephropathy. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are 
      important mediators of structural and functional renal abnormalities in diabetic 
      nephropathy. We and others have previously described that mice with a deletion in 
      the gene for the cell cycle regulatory p27(Kip1) are protected from some features 
      of diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: The present study investigates a potential 
      influence of AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) on podocyte growth and 
      p27(Kip1) expression in culture. The p27(Kip1) expression was measured by western 
      blots and real-time PCR. Cell cycle analysis, cell hypertrophy, proliferation and 
      various markers of apoptosis and necrosis were assessed. The p27(Kip) expression 
      was inhibited by siRNA or was overexpressed in podocytes with an inducible 
      expression system. RESULTS: AGE-BSA was actively taken up into the cell as 
      determined by immunohistochemistry, western blots and HPLC. Incubation with 
      AGE-BSA induced in differentiated podocytes, but not in tubular cells, p27(Kip1) 
      mRNA and protein expression. This induction was associated with cell cycle arrest 
      of podocytes, cell hypertrophy (as measured by increases in cell size and 
      protein/cell number ratios) and an increase in necrotic, but not apoptotic cells. 
      Inhibition of p27(Kip1) expression with siRNA halted the AGE-BSA-mediated cell 
      cycle arrest and hypertrophy, but did not interfere with AGE uptake into 
      podocytes. In contrast, overexpression of p27(Kip1) using an inducible expression 
      system stimulated hypertrophy and cell cycle arrest of podocytes. CONCLUSION: Our 
      data demonstrate that AGE-BSA-induced hypertrophy and damage of cultured 
      podocytes occurs by a mechanism involving p27(Kip1). This effect can contribute 
      to the loss of podocytes in diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Gastric Bypass Surgery Improves the Skeletal Muscle Ceramide/S1P Ratio and 
      Upregulates the AMPK/ SIRT1/ PGC-1α Pathway in Zucker Diabetic Fatty Rats.
PG  - 2158-2165

AB  - PURPOSE: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is associated with remission of type 2 
      diabetes. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We 
      hypothesized that RYGB would increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), AMPK/pAMPK, and citrate 
      synthase (CS) protein expression and decrease insulin resistance and these 
      changes would be mediated by sphingolipids, including ceramides and the 
      sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Male ZDF rats were randomized to RYGB (n = 7) or sham surgery (n = 7) and 
      harvested after 28 days. Total tissue ceramide, ceramide subspecies (C14:0, 
      C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C20:0, C24:0, and C24:1), and S1P were quantified in the 
      white gastrocnemius muscle using LC-ESI-MS/MS after separation with HPLC. Total 
      SIRT1, AMPK, PGC-1α, and CS protein expression were measured by Western blot. 
      RESULTS: Body weight, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR decreased 
      significantly after RYGB compared with sham control. These changes were 
      paralleled by lower total ceramide (483.7 ± 32.3 vs. 280.1 ± 38.8 nmol/g wwt), 
      C18:0 ceramide subspecies (P < 0.05), higher S1P (0.83 ± 0.05 vs. 
      1.54 ± 0.21 nmol/g wwt, P < 0.05), and a lower ceramide/S1P ratio (P < 0.05) in 
      the RYGB versus sham group. AMPK, pAMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1α, and CS protein expression 
      was also higher after RYGB (P < 0.05). The ceramide/S1P ratio correlated with 
      weight loss (r = 0.48, P = 0.08), insulin resistance (r = 0.61, P = 0.02), PGC-1α 
      (r = - 0.51, P < 0.06), CS (r = - 0.63, P = 0.01), and SIRT1 (r = - 0.54, 
      P < 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that sphingolipid balance, and 
      increased AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1α, and CS protein expression are part of the 
      mechanism that contributes to the remission of diabetes after RYGB surgery.

TI  - Hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of total saponins from Stauntonia 
      chinensis in diabetic db/db mice.
PG  - 6026-6038
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13876 [doi]
AB  - Stauntonia chinensis DC. has been utilised as a traditional herbal medicine for 
      its anti-hyperglycemic characteristic, which has been associated with triterpene 
      saponins. The goal of the current evaluation was to examine hypoglycemic activity 
      and affiliated mechanism of total saponins from S. chinensis. The chemical 
      composition was analysed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The fasting blood glucose, oral 
      glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, insulin and glycogen levels of 
      type 2 diabetic db/db mice administered total saponins were quantified to 
      determine the hypoglycemic effects. The serum lipid profiles were assessed to 
      determine the hypolipidemic effects. Western blotting was used to quantify the 
      protein levels of insulin receptor substrates (IRS)-1/PI3K/AKT, AMPK/ACC and 
      GLUT4. Twenty triterpene saponins were identified from the total saponins, which 
      exhibited hypoglycemic activities and modulated hyperlipidemia that was 
      associated with type 2 diabetes. The hypoglycemic effects were partly due to the 
      activation of GLUT4, which is regulated by IRS-1/PI3K/AKT. The activation of the 
      AMPK/ACC signalling pathway may be responsible for the hypolipidemic activity. 
      This study revealed that total saponins from S. chinensis have significant 
      hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activity in diabetic db/db mice, indicating that 
      these may be utilised in the development of saponins based on S. chinensis for 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Ethanol extract of mulberry leaves partially restores the composition of 
      intestinal microbiota and strengthens liver glycogen fragility in type 2 diabetic 
      rats.
PG  - 172

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mulberry leaf as a traditional Chinese medicine is able to treat 
      obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. It is well known that diabetes leads to 
      intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. It is also recently discovered that liver 
      glycogen structure is impaired in diabetic animals. Since mulberry leaves are 
      able to improve the diabetic conditions through reducing blood glucose level, it 
      would be interesting to investigate whether they have any positive effects on 
      intestinal microbiota and liver glycogen structure. METHODS: In this study, we 
      first determined the bioactive components of ethanol extract of mulberry leaves 
      via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass 
      spectrometry (LC/MS). Murine animal models were divided into three groups, normal 
      Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced 
      type 2 diabetic rats, and HFD/STZ-induced rats administered with ethanol extract 
      of mulberry leaves (200 mg/kg/day). Composition of intestinal microbiota was 
      analyzed via metagenomics by sequencing the V3-V4 region of 16S rDNAs. Liver 
      glycogen structure was characterized through size exclusion chromatography (SEC). 
      Both Student's t-test and Tukey's test were used for statistical analysis. 
      RESULTS: A group of type 2 diabetic rat models were successfully established. 
      Intestinal microbiota analysis showed that ethanol extract of mulberry leaves 
      could partially change intestinal microbiota back to normal conditions. In 
      addition, liver glycogen was restored from fragile state to stable state through 
      administration of ethanol extract of mulberry leaves. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      confirms that the ethanol extract of mulberry leaves (MLE) ameliorates intestinal 
      microbiota dysbiosis and strengthens liver glycogen fragility in diabetic rats. 
      These finding can be helpful in discovering the novel therapeutic targets with 
      the help of further investigations.

TI  - Curcumin activates the p38MPAK-HSP25 pathway in vitro but fails to attenuate 
      diabetic nephropathy in DBA2J mice despite urinary clearance documented by HPLC.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-10-67 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Curcumin has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-proliferative 
      properties, and depending upon the experimental circumstances, may be pro- or 
      anti-apoptotic. Many of these biological actions could ameliorate diabetic 
      nephropathy. METHODS/DESIGN: Mouse podocytes, cultured in basal or high glucose 
      conditions, underwent acute exposure to curcumin. Western blots for p38-MAPK, 
      COX-2 and cleaved caspase-3; isoelectric focusing for HSP25 phosphorylation; and 
      DNase I assays for F- to G- actin cleavage were performed for in vitro analyses. 
      In vivo studies examined the effects of dietary curcumin on the development of 
      diabetic nephropathy in streptozotocin (Stz)-induced diabetes in DBA2J mice. 
      Urinary albumin to creatinine ratios were obtained, high performance liquid 
      chromatography was performed for urinary curcuminoid measurements, and Western 
      blots for p38-MAPK and total HSP25 were performed. RESULTS: Curcumin enhanced the 
      phosphorylation of both p38MAPK and downstream HSP25; inhibited COX-2; induced a 
      trend towards attenuation of F- to G-actin cleavage; and dramatically inhibited 
      the activation of caspase-3 in vitro. In curcumin-treated DBA2J mice with 
      Stz-diabetes, HPLC measurements confirmed the presence of urinary curcuminoid. 
      Nevertheless, dietary provision of curcumin either before or after the induction 
      of diabetes failed to attenuate albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from species, 
      strain, early differences in glycemic control, and/or dosing effects, the failure 
      to modulate albuminuria may have been due to a decrement in renal HSP25 or 
      stimulation of the 12/15 lipoxygenase pathway in DBA2J mice fed curcumin. In 
      addition, these studies suggest that timed urine collections may be useful for 
      monitoring curcumin dosing and renal pharmacodynamic effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cinnamomum cassia bark is the outer skin of an evergreen tall tree 
      belonging to the family Lauraceae containing several active components such as 
      essential oils (cinnamic aldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde), tannin, mucus and 
      carbohydrate. They have various biological functions including anti-oxidant, 
      anti-microbial, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetic and anti-tumor activity. 
      Previously, we have reported that anti-cancer effect of cinnamon extracts is 
      associated with modulation of angiogenesis and effector function of CD8+ T cells. 
      In this study, we further identified that anti-tumor effect of cinnamon extracts 
      is also link with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity by inhibiting the activities 
      NFkappaB and AP1 in mouse melanoma model. METHODS: Water soluble cinnamon extract 
      was obtained and quality of cinnamon extract was evaluated by HPLC (High 
      Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. In this study, we tested anti-tumor 
      activity and elucidated action mechanism of cinnamon extract using various types 
      of tumor cell lines including lymphoma, melanoma, cervix cancer and colorectal 
      cancer in vitro and in vivo mouse melanoma model. RESULTS: Cinnamon extract 
      strongly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induced active cell 
      death of tumor cells by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules while inhibiting 
      NFkappaB and AP1 activity and their target genes such as Bcl-2, BcL-xL and 
      survivin. Oral administration of cinnamon extract in melanoma transplantation 
      model significantly inhibited tumor growth with the same mechanism of action 
      observed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that anti-tumor effect of 
      cinnamon extracts is directly linked with enhanced pro-apoptotic activity and 
      inhibition of NFkappaB and AP1 activities and their target genes in vitro and in 
      vivo mouse melanoma model. Hence, further elucidation of active components of 
      cinnamon extract could lead to development of potent anti-tumor agent or 
      complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of diverse cancers.

TI  - The anti-diabetic activities, gut microbiota composition, the anti-inflammatory 
      effects of Scutellaria-coptis herb couple against insulin resistance-model of 
      diabetes involving the toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Scutellaria-coptis herb couple (SC) is one of the 
      well-known herb couples in many traditional Chinese compound formulas used for 
      the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), which has been used to treat DM for 
      thousands of years in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: Few studies have confirmed in 
      detail the anti-diabetic activities of SC in vivo and in vitro. The present 
      investigations aimed to evaluate the anti-diabetic activity of SC in type 2 
      diabetic KK-Ay mice and in RAW264.7 macrophages to understand its possible 
      mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography with 
      ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) and LC-LTQ-Orbitrap Pro mass spectrometry were 
      used to analyze the active ingredients of SC extracts and control the quality. A 
      type 2 diabetic KK-Ay mice model was established by high-fat diet. Body weight, 
      fasting blood glucose levels, fasting blood insulin levels, glycosylated 
      hemoglobin and glycosylated serum protein were measured. The effects of SC on 
      total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride (TG) 
      levels were examined. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 
      tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels were measured. Gut microbial 
      communities were assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-denaturing 
      gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) methods. The expressions of Toll-like 
      receptor 4 (TLR4) and MyD88 protein in the colons were measured by western blot. 
      In RAW264.7 macrophages, IL-6, TNF-α, TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels were measured 
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits or western blot, and the mRNA 
      expression of IL-6, TNF-α and TLR4 was examined by the real time PCR. RESULTS: 
      The present results showed that the SC significantly increased blood HDL and 
      significantly reduced fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, glycosylated 
      hemoglobin, glycosylated serum protein, TC, TG, LPS, IL-6 and TNF-α levels 
      (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in type-2 diabetic KK-Ay mice. Furthermore, SC could 
      regulate the structure of intestinal flora. Additionally, the expressions of TLR4 
      and MyD88 protein in the colons were significantly decreased in the model group 
      (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, SC had no significant effect on weight gain. In 
      RAW264.7 macrophages, SC containing serum (SC-CS) (5%, 10% and 20%) significantly 
      decreased IL-6, TNF-α, TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels and the mRNA expression of 
      IL-6, TNF-α and TLR4 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The anti-diabetic 
      effects of SC were attributed to its regulation of intestinal flora and 
      anti-inflammation involving the TLR4 signaling pathway. These findings provide a 
      new insight into the anti-diabetic application for SC in clinical settings and 
      display the potential of SC in the treatment of DM.

AB  - Triplostegia glandulifera Wall (T. glandulifera) is an ethnomedicine commonly 
      used by ethnic minorities in Yunnan, China, to treat kidney disease. However, 
      there are few reports on the renoprotective effects of this substance, and the 
      active ingredients remain unclear. In this study, we extracted the polysaccharide 
      fractions TGB and TGC using the water extraction-alcohol precipitation method and 
      determined their molecular weight (Mw) and monosaccharide composition. The study 
      investigated the protective effects of TGB and TGC fractions against diabetic 
      nephropathy (DN) using an in vitro high glucose-induced HRMCs model and an in 
      vivo STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. HPLC analysis revealed that TGB contained 
      D-galacturonic acid, D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-arabinose, and had a lower Mw 
      than TGC. In vitro, TGB showed concentration-dependent antioxidant activity and 
      effectively reduced abnormal proliferation and while attenuating oxidative stress 
      in HRMCs. In mice with diabetes, TGB corrected the dysregulation of glucose-lipid 
      metabolism and alleviated oxidative stress in the kidneys. Additionally, it 
      improved renal function and reduced renal tissue damage. The study suggests that 
      the low Mw polysaccharides (TGB) have better activity against DN through the 
      antioxidative stress mechanism.

AB  - Jiao Tai Wan (JTW), a Chinese herbal formula containing Rhizoma Coptidis and 
      Cortex Cinnamomi, has been used for diabetic treatment for many years. The aim of 
      this study was to determine the main components in JTW and to investigate the 
      effects of JTW on hepatic lipid accumulation in diabetic rats and humans. JTW 
      extract was prepared and the main components were assayed by HPLC. An animal 
      model of diabetes mellitus was established and JTW was administered 
      intragastrically. In the clinical study, diabetic patients with poor glycemic 
      control were treated with JTW. Blood glucose and lipid parameters, liver 
      histology, hepatic triglyceride content and lipogenic gene expression were 
      examined. Our data demonstrated that JTW significantly improved hyperglycemia, 
      hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in diabetic rats. This was 
      accompanied by the down-regulation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and 
      fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein expressions, and the up-regulation of 
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and phosphorylated-ACC (pACC) protein 
      expressions in the liver tissues. Diabetic patients also exhibited decreases in 
      their hepatic triglyceride content. The results suggest that JTW attenuates 
      hepatic lipid accumulation in diabetic rats and humans. These beneficial effects 
      are possibly associated with the inhibition of lipogenic gene expression in the 
      liver.

AB  - A validated quantitative method for the determination of free and total 
      carnitine, butyrobetaine, and acylcarnitines is presented. The versatile method 
      has four components: (1) isolation using strong cation-exchange solid-phase 
      extraction, (2) derivatization with pentafluorophenacyl 
      trifluoromethanesulfonate, (3) sequential ion-exchange/reversed-phase (ultra) 
      high-performance liquid chromatography [(U)HPLC] using a strong cation-exchange 
      trap in series with a fused-core HPLC column, and (4) detection with electrospray 
      ionization multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry (MS). 
      Standardized carnitine along with 65 synthesized, standardized acylcarnitines 
      (including short-chain, medium-chain, long-chain, dicarboxylic, hydroxylated, and 
      unsaturated acyl moieties) were used to construct multiple-point calibration 
      curves, resulting in accurate and precise quantification. Separation of the 65 
      acylcarnitines was accomplished in a single chromatogram in as little as 14 min. 
      Validation studies were performed showing a high level of accuracy, precision, 
      and reproducibility. The method provides capabilities unavailable by tandem MS 
      procedures, making it an ideal approach for confirmation of newborn screening 
      results and for clinical and basic research projects, including treatment 
      protocol studies, acylcarnitine biomarker studies, and metabolite studies using 
      plasma, urine, tissue, or other sample matrixes.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gangjihwan (DF) which is composed of Ephedra 
      intermedia, Lithospermum erythrorhizon, and Rheum palmatum has been used for the 
      treatment of obesity in traditional medical clinics in Korea. AIM OF THE STUDY: 
      This study was conducted to standardize DF and elucidate its mechanism of action 
      for inhibiting fat accumulation in adipocytes and adipose tissues. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The herbal ingredients of DF were extracted in water, 30% ethanol or 70% 
      ethanol and freeze-dried followed by HPLC analyses. 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 
      high-fat diet-induced obese mice were treated with each of the three DF 
      preparations. Messenger RNA and protein expression levels were measured by 
      real-time qPCR and Western blotting. RNA-Seq analyses were conducted to examine 
      the effects of DF treatment on whole transcriptome of adipocyte. RESULTS: 
      (-)-Ephedrine and (+)-pseudoephedrine from E. intermedia, aloe-emodin and 
      chrysophanol from R. palmatum and shikonin from L. erythrorhizon were identified 
      as phytochemical components of DF. DF caused dose-dependent inhibition of fat 
      accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It also significantly reduced adipose tissue 
      mass and adipocyte size in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. DF was found to 
      down-regulate the expressions of the lipogenic transcription factors such as 
      sterol regulatory element binding protein 1C (SREBP1C), peroxisome proliferator 
      activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha 
      (C/EBPα). Among the three preparations of DF, the 70% ethanol extract was the 
      most effective. RNA-Seq analyses showed that DF treatment decreased the 
      expression levels of up-regulators and increased those of down-regulators of 
      lipogenic transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: DF preparations, among which 70% 
      ethanol extract was the most effective, reduced fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 
      adipocytes and high-fat diet-induced obese mice through the down-regulation of 
      lipogenic transcription factors SREBP1C, PPARγ and C/EBPα.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory activity of Barleria lupulina: Identification of active

      reduce stress fibers, and improve cell junctions in microvascular endothelial 
      cells.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hot aqueous extracts of the plant Barleria 
      lupulina (BL) are used for treating inflammatory conditions and diabetic vascular 
      complications. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal was to identify active compounds in hot 
      aqueous extracts of BL (HAE-BL) that are consistent with a role in reducing 
      inflammation and reducing the vascular pathology associated with diabetes. In 
      particular, we examined activation of the Nrf2 cell defense pathway because our 
      initial findings indicated that HAE-BL activates Nrf2, and because Nrf2 is known 
      to suppress inflammation. Activation of Nrf2 by HAE-BL has not been described 
      previously. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human endothelial cells, real-time PCR, 
      western blotting, cytoskeletal analyses, and assay-guided fractionation with HPLC 
      were used to identify specific compounds in HAE-BL that activate the Nrf2 cell 
      defense pathway and reduce markers of inflammation in vitro. RESULTS: HAE-BL 
      potently activated the Nrf2 cell defense pathway in endothelial cells consistent 
      with its traditional use and reported success in reducing inflammation. Assay 
      guided fractionation with HPLC identified three alkyl catechols: 4-ethylcatechol, 
      4-vinylcatechol, and 4-methylcatechol, that are each potent Nrf2 activators. In 
      addition to activating Nrf2, HAE-BL and akyl catechols each profoundly improved 
      organization of the endothelial cell actin cytoskeleton, reduced actin stress 
      fibers, organized cell-cell junctions, and induced expression of mRNA encoding 
      claudin-5 that is important for formation of endothelial tight junctions and 
      reducing vascular leak. CONCLUSIONS: HAE-BL contains important alkyl catechols 
      that potently activate the Nrf2 cell defense pathway, improve organization of the 
      endothelial cell cytoskeleton, and organize tight cell junctions. All of these 
      properties are consistent with a role in reducing inflammation and reducing 
      vascular leak. Because activation of the Nrf2 cell defense pathway also prevents 
      cancers, neuro-degeneration, age-related macular degeneration, and also reduces 
      the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and multiple sclerosis, 
      HAE-BL warrants additional consideration for these other serious disorders.

      Dietary Intakes on General Adult Population.

AB  - There is increasing evidence for the interaction between gut microbiome, diet, 
      and health. It is known that dysbiosis is related to disease and that most of the 
      times this imbalances in gut microbial populations can be promoted through diet. 
      Western dietary habits, which are characterized by high intakes of calories, 
      animal proteins, saturated fats, and simple sugars have been linked with higher 
      risk of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. However, little is 
      known about the impact of dietary patterns, dietary components, and nutrients on 
      gut microbiota in healthy people. The aim of our study is to determine the effect 
      of nutrient compounds as well as adherence to a dietary pattern, as the 
      Mediterranean diet (MD) on the gut microbiome of healthy adults. Consequently, 
      gut microbiota composition in healthy individuals, may be used as a potential 
      biomarker to identify nutritional habits as well as risk of disease related to 
      these habits. Dietary information from healthy volunteers (n = 27) was recorded 
      using the Food Frequency Questionnaire. Adherence to the MD was measured using 
      the PREDIMED test. Microbiota composition and diversity were obtained by 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing and specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Microbial 
      metabolic activity was determined by quantification of short chain fatty acids 
      (SCFA) on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results indicated 
      that a higher ratio of Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes was related to lower adherence to 
      the MD, and greater presence of Bacteroidetes was associated with lower animal 
      protein intake. High consumption of animal protein, saturated fats, and sugars 
      affected gut microbiota diversity. A significant higher presence of 
      Christensenellaceae was found in normal-weight individuals compared to those who 
      were overweight. This was also the case in volunteers with greater adherence to 
      the MD compared to those with lower adherence. Butyricimonas, Desulfovibrio, and 
      Oscillospira genera were associated with a BMI <25 and the genus Catenibacterium 
      with a higher PREDIMED score. Higher bifidobacterial counts, and higher total 
      SCFA were related to greater consumption of plant-based nutrients, such as 
      vegetable proteins and polysaccharides. Better adherence to the MD was associated 
      with significantly higher levels of total SCFA. Consequently, diet and specific 
      dietary components could affect microbiota composition, diversity, and activity, 
      which may have an effect on host metabolism by increasing the risk of Western 
      diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases that 
      accompanied by severe complications. Gynura divaricata (GD), a medicinal and 
      edible plant that is usually used for the treatment of diabetes. Therefore, this 
      study investigates the chemical components of GD with hypoglycemic effect and the 
      possible mechanism lowering blood sugar in T2D diabetic mice. METHODS: The 
      methanol extract of GD was analysed by HPLC-DAD. And then mice with type 2 
      diabetes induced by a high-fat diet in combination with streptozotocin feed the 
      diet containing lyophilized GD powder for 4 weeks. During this period, fasting 
      blood glucose (FBG) levels and body weight were measured. RESULTS: GD was rich in 
      four bioactive components of dicaffeoylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid. These 
      components occupied about 2.37% in the GD powder in which the highest level was 
      3, 5-dicaffeoylquinic acid. Oral GD significantly reduced FBG, fasting serum 
      insulin, and glycosylated serum protein levels, and enhanced antioxidative 
      activities. HE-staining showed that the pathological damage in pancreatic β-cells 
      was ameliorated. An immunohistochemical assay also showed that GD promoted marked 
      pancreatic β-cell regeneration. GD also caused notable increase in GLUT2, GK, 
      MafA, PDX-1, and Bcl-2 as well as reduction in Bax and caspase-3 expression as 
      shown by western blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS: GD exerts the pronounced 
      hypoglycaemic effect by inhibiting islet cell apoptosis and improving pancreatic 
      function. Therefore, GD might have a potential to improve diabetes.

TI  - Lisofylline, an inhibitor of unsaturated phosphatidic acid generation, 
      ameliorates interleukin-1 beta-induced dysfunction in cultured rat islets.
PG  - 4871-7
AB  - Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) causes rat islet cell dysfunction through 
      mechanisms that involve inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). However, IL-1 
      beta also activates several lipid pathways, including those generating 
      phosphatidic acid (PA). Lisofylline (LSF), a water-soluble, nontoxic, selective 
      inhibitor of the PA-1 alpha subspecies, which is stimulated by IL-1 beta and 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha, has been shown to prevent cytokine-induced 
      cytotoxicity in in vivo animal models. To evaluate the effect of LSF on acute 
      IL-1 beta-induced islet dysfunction, rat islets were exposed to IL-1 beta (0.1 
      ng/ml) with or without LSF (100 microM) for 24 h, followed by 25 mM glucose (G) 
      stimulation, measurement of rat insulin by RIA, and calculation of the insulin 
      secretion rate. In other experiments, rat islets were precultured for 48 h, then 
      treated for 48 h in 25 mM G with or without IL-1 beta (0.1 ng/ml) and LSF (400 
      microM), and aliquots of medium were removed at 0, 24, and 48 h for measurement 
      of rat insulin. In addition, islets were exposed to 25 mM G with or without IL-1 
      beta and LSF, lipids were then extracted, and PA subspecies were identified by 
      TLC and mass spectroscopy, and quantitated using normal phase HPLC. Islets were 
      also exposed to IL-1 beta with or without LSF, and Western immunoblots were 
      performed to evaluate the effect of LSF on iNOS protein expression. IL-1 beta 
      caused a 44% decrease in islet G-stimulated insulin secretion compared to that in 
      untreated islets (P < 0.0005), which was totally reversed by LSF. In addition, 
      IL-1 beta decreased the G-stimulated medium insulin content by 75% at 24 h (P = 
      0.0004) and 86% at 48 h compared to that in control islets (P < 0.0001). 
      LSF-treated islets maintained 70% of medium insulin content at 24 h (P = 0.11) 
      and 50% at 48 h (P < 0.0001) compared to control islets. HPLC quantitation of 
      PA-1 alpha extracted from islets treated with IL-1 beta alone showed an 
      approximately 15-fold increase over the PA-1 alpha content of islets treated with 
      IL-1 beta and LSF. IL-1 beta-induced expression of iNOS was unchanged with the 
      addition of LSF. These results suggest that LSF is effective in reducing IL-1 
      beta-induced islet dysfunction, thus supporting the role of lipid mediators such 
      as PA in cytokine-induced islet toxicity.

TI  - Chromatographic quantification of argpyrimidine, a methylglyoxal-derived product 
      in tissue proteins: comparison with pentosidine.
PG  - 353-8
AB  - Methylglyoxal (MG), an alpha-dicarbonyl compound, can be produced in vivo by 
      several metabolic pathways and the Maillard reaction. It reacts rapidly with 
      proteins to form advanced glycation end products or AGEs. We previously isolated 
      and characterized a blue fluorescent product of the reaction between MG and 
      arginine, which we named argpyrimidine. We found that argpyrimidine was stable to 
      acid hydrolysis, which allowed us to hydrolyze tissue proteins with 6 N HCl and 
      quantify argpyrimidine by high-performance liquid chromatography. Here we report 
      argpyrimidine concentrations in human lens and serum proteins as determined by 
      HPLC. We have also measured pentosidine, a fluorescent AGE derived from pentose 
      sugars, and compared the concentrations of pentosidine and argpyrimidine. We 
      found two- to threefold higher argpyrimidine concentrations in diabetic serum 
      proteins than in nondiabetic controls (9.3 +/- 6.7 vs 4.4 +/- 3.4 pmol/mg). We 
      found a significant correlation (P = 0.0001) between serum protein argpyrimidine 
      and glycosylated hemoglobin. Argpyrimidine concentrations were approximately 
      seven times greater in brunescent cataractous lenses than in aged noncataractous 
      lenses. Pentosidine concentrations in serum and lens proteins were much lower 
      than argpyrimidine concentrations; in general, argpyrimidine levels were 10--25 
      times higher than pentosidine. Results from our study confirm that MG-mediated 
      arginine modifications occur in vivo and provide a method for assessing 
      protein-arginine modification by MG in aging and diabetes.

TI  - Tetrahydrobiopterin contributes to the proliferation of mesangial cells and 
      accumulation of extracellular matrix in early-stage diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 182-190
LID - 10.1111/jphp.12677 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the progression of 
      early-stage diabetic nephropathy (DN), which is found to contribute to 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in mesangial cells (MCs). As a cofactor 
      for NO production, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4) ), a folacin analogue, may be 
      responsible for the ECM accumulation and proliferation of MCs. This study was to 
      investigate the effects of BH(4) on glomerulosclerosis in early-stage DN. 
      METHODS: In in vitro studies with cultured mesangial cells and in vivo studies 
      with streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, BH(4) levels were assayed by HPLC; NO 
      was determined by Griess agents; laminin and collagen IV were determined by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the inducible NO synthase protein was 
      determined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot; and mesangial matrix 
      expansion and MC proliferation in the renal cortex were observed by periodic 
      acid-schiff staining and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. KEY 
      FINDINGS: The in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that the increased BH(4) 
      resulted in the overproduction of NO, ECM accumulation and the proliferation of 
      MCs in early-stage DN. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that inhibiting excessive 
      BH(4) may be a potential approach to prevent glomerulosclerosis in early-stage 
      DN.

TI  - Further isolation and identification of anti-diabetic principles from root bark

      phenolic compounds that improve liver cell glucose homeostasis.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: We recently reported that ethanol extract of 
      Myrianthus arboreus P. Beauv. root bark demonstrated antidiabetic activity by 
      modulating hepatocyte glucose homeostasis. This activity was associated 
      significantly to the ethyl acetate (EAc) fraction. The current study sought to 
      identify the active compounds responsible of the antidiabetic effect of M. 
      arboreus in the EAc fraction using bioassay-directed sub-fractionation. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: EAc fraction was sub-fractionated using Flash chromatography. 
      Preparative HPLC was used to isolate the pure compounds. The structures of the 
      isolated compounds were confirmed by analysis of NMR spectroscopic and mass 
      spectrometric data. Hepatic (H4IIE, HepG2) cells were treated with maximum 
      non-toxic concentrations of ethanol extract, its EAc fraction and isolated 
      compounds thereof. Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity was measured using the 
      glucose oxidase method. To measure glycogen synthase (GS) activity, radioactive 
      assays were used. Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 
      Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) were probed by Western blot. RESULTS: Six 
      sub-fractions were obtained, and the antidiabetic activity was found in two 
      sub-fractions (SFE1 and SFE2). For the first time, two known C-glycosylflavone 
      regio-isomers, isoorientin (1) and orientin (2) were detected and isolated from 
      M. arboreus plant, especially from SFE2 as well as protocatechuic acid, 
      3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (4), and chlorogenic acid isolated from SFE1. The 
      compounds 1, 2, 4 were determined to decrease the activity of G6Pase by 
      increasing AMPK phosphorylation and to stimulate GS through GSK-3 
      phosphorylation. Isoorientin which is one of the main compounds of EAc fraction, 
      expressed the strongest effect in all bioassays, similar to that of the EAc 
      fraction. A significant and linear correlation was found between the 
      phosphorylation of AMPK and the activity of G6Pase modulated by all samples 
      (R(2) = 0.54; p < 0.05). Similar to G6Pase assay, a correlation was determined 
      between the capacity of M. arboreus extracts/fractions/compounds to stimulate GS 
      activity and to phosphorylate GSK-3 (R(2) = 0.57, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Results 
      demonstrate that 1, 2, 4 are responsible, at least in part, for the antidiabetic 
      activity of M. arboreus. These compounds can be used to ensure the quality and 
      efficacy of M. arboreus antidiabetic preparations and standardize such 
      preparations.

TI  - Chronic estrogen deficiency causes gastroparesis by altering neuronal nitric 
      oxide synthase function.
PG  - 1507-15
LID - 10.1007/s10620-013-2610-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastroparesis affects predominantly females; however, the biological 
      basis for this gender bias is completely unknown. Several lines of evidence 
      suggest that nitrergic dependent stomach motility function is reduced in diabetic 
      gastroparesis and that nNOS is estrogen-regulated. AIMS: The purpose of this 
      study was to investigate whether reduced levels of estradiol-17β (E2) 
      down-regulates tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, a cofactor for nNOS dimerization and 
      enzyme activity) biosynthesis and therefore nNOS mediated gastric motility would 
      be impaired in a mouse model of chronic estrogen deficiency, follicle stimulating 
      hormone receptor knock-out female mice (FORKO). METHODS: In-bred 12-week-old 
      female FORKO mice were obtained from our FORKO breeding colony. Gastric emptying 
      was measured in overnight fasting mice. Nitrergic relaxation (AUC/mg tissue) was 
      measured at 2 Hz through electric field stimulation using gastric antrum strips 
      prepared from WT and FORKO mice. Protein expression for nNOSα, BH4 biosynthesis 
      enzymes (GCH-1, DHFR) and estrogen receptors (α, β) were measured in gastric 
      antrum by western blotting. Levels of BH4 and oxidized BH2, B biopterin levels 
      were determined by HPLC. RESULTS: In FORKO, compared to wild type (WT) stomachs 
      we indentified (1) reduced (%) gastric emptying (64 ± 2.5 vs. 77.6 ± 0.88), (2) 
      greater reduction in nitregic relaxation (-0.13 ± 0.012 vs. -0.28 ± 0.012), (3) 
      increased nNOS dimerization (0.48 ± 0.02 vs. 0.34 ± 0.05), (4) decreased NO 
      release whether measured at 24 h (0.6 ± 0.04 vs. 1.7 ± 0.22, p < 0.05) or at 48 h 
      (3.4 ± 0.26 vs. 5.0 ± 0.15, p < 0.05) of incubation, (5) decreased GCH-1 (1.9 ± 
      0.06 vs. 2.3 ± 0.04), DHFR (1.8 ± 0.14 vs. 2.4 ± 0.07) and ERα (2.7 ± 0.4 vs. 3.9 
      ± 0.4) and (6) increased oxidized biopterin levels and decreased ratio of BH4 
      versus BH2 + B. CONCLUSION: We conclude that chronic estrogen deficiency 
      negatively modifies the function of both BH4 and nNOS thereby contributing to the 
      development of gastroparesis in a FORKO mouse model.

TI  - Cuscuta chinensis seeds water extraction protecting murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 
      cells against tertiary butyl hydroperoxide induced injury.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cuscuta chinensis (C. chinensis) is a well-known 
      traditional Chinese herb that has been used to treat heart disease, diabetes, 
      liver injury, cancer, and aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Murine osteoblastic 
      MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with various concentrations of C. chinensis water 
      extraction at different time intervals. The antioxidant effect of C. chinensis on 
      MC3T3-E1 cells was evaluated using MTT and TUNEL assays. The effect of C. 
      chinensis on cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide. 
      Lipid peroxidation was measured by the HPLC method. The cellular redox status was 
      determined from the reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) 
      and the enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism, including glutathione 
      reductase (GR), Glutathione S-transferase (GST), and Glucose-6-phosphate 
      dehydrogenase (G6PD). The changes in relative mitochondrial transmembrane 
      potential (ΔΨm) in the MC3T3-E1 cells were analyzed with rhodamine 123 staining. 
      Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the levels of cytochrome c (cyto c), 
      Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3, Sirt3, and IDH2 expressions. RESULTS: The C. chinensis 
      water extraction protects tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-treated MC3T3-E1 
      cells from death in a dose-dependent manner. C. chinensis treatment significantly 
      inhibited the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) 
      production, and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), GR, GST, 
      and G6PD. The release of cyto c from mitochondria was reduced by C. chinensis, 
      which increased the expression of antiapoptotic IDH2, Sirt3, and Bcl-2 and 
      decreased the expression of Bax, cyto c, and caspase 3. CONCLUSIONS: C. chinensis 
      modulated the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells, probably due 
      to its antioxidant activity and functioning via mitochondria-dependent pathways.

TI  - Podocyte vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf₁₆₄) overexpression causes 
      severe nodular glomerulosclerosis in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 1227-41
LID - 10.1007/s00125-010-2034-z [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The pathogenic role of excessive vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF)-A in diabetic nephropathy has not been defined. We sought to test 
      whether increased podocyte VEGF-A signalling determines the severity of diabetic 
      glomerulopathy. METHODS: Podocyte-specific, doxycycline-inducible Vegf₁₆₄ (the 
      most abundant Vegfa isoform) overexpressing adult transgenic mice were made 
      diabetic with low doses of streptozotocin and examined 12 weeks after onset of 
      diabetes. We studied diabetic and non-diabetic transgenic mice fed a standard or 
      doxycycline-containing diet. VEGF-A and albuminuria were measured by ELISA, 
      creatinine was measured by HPLC, renal morphology was examined by light and 
      electron microscopy, and gene expression was assessed by quantitative PCR, 
      immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Podocyte Vegf₁₆₄ overexpression 
      in our mouse model of diabetes resulted in advanced diabetic glomerulopathy, 
      characterised by Kimmelstiel-Wilson-like nodular glomerulosclerosis, 
      microaneurysms, mesangiolysis, glomerular basement membrane thickening, podocyte 
      effacement and massive proteinuria associated with hyperfiltration. It also led 
      to increased VEGF receptor 2 and semaphorin3a levels, as well as nephrin and 
      matrix metalloproteinase-2 downregulation, whereas circulating VEGF-A levels were 
      similar to those in control diabetic mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: 
      Collectively, these data demonstrate that increased podocyte Vegf₁₆₄ signalling 
      dramatically worsens diabetic nephropathy in a streptozotocin-induced mouse model 
      of diabetes, resulting in nodular glomerulosclerosis and massive proteinuria. 
      This suggests that local rather than systemic VEGF-A levels determine the 
      severity of diabetic nephropathy and that semaphorin3a signalling and matrix 
      metalloproteinase-2 dysregulation are mechanistically involved in severe diabetic 
      glomerulopathy.

TI  - Metabolic Profiling of Liver Tissue in Diabetic Mice Treated with Artemisia 
      Capillaris and Alisma Rhizome Using LC-MS and CE-MS.
PG  - 1639-1661
AB  - Artemisia Capillaris (AC) and Alisma Rhizome (AR) are natural products for the 
      treatment of liver disorders in oriental medicine clinics. Here, we report 
      metabolomic changes in the evaluation of the treatment effects of AC and AR on 
      fatty livers in diabetic mice, along with a proposition of the underlying 
      metabolic pathway. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic metabolites extracted from mouse 
      livers were analyzed using HPLC-QTOF and CE-QTOF, respectively, to generate 
      metabolic profiles. Statistical analysis of the metabolites by PLS-DA and OPLA-DA 
      fairly discriminated between the diabetic, and the AC- and AR-treated mice 
      groups. Various PEs mostly contributed to the discrimination of the diabetic mice 
      from the normal mice, and besides, DG (18:1/16:0), TG (16:1/16:1/20:1), PE 
      (21:0/20:5), and PA (18:0/21:0) were also associated with discrimination by 
      s-plot. Nevertheless, the effects of AC and AR treatment were indistinct with 
      respect to lipid metabolites. Of the 97 polar metabolites extracted from the 
      CE-MS data, 40 compounds related to amino acid, central carbon, lipid, purine, 
      and pyrimidine metabolism, with [Formula: see text] values less than 0.05, were 
      shown to contribute to liver dysregulation. Following treatment with AC and AR, 
      the metabolites belonging to purine metabolism preferentially recovered to the 
      metabolic state of the normal mice. The AMP/ATP ratio of cellular energy 
      homeostasis in AR-treated mice was more apparently increased ([Formula: see 
      text]) than that of AC-treated mice. On the other hand, amino acids, which showed 
      the main alterations in diabetic mice, did not return to the normal levels upon 
      treatment with AR or AC. In terms of metabolomics, AR was a more effective 
      natural product in the treatment of liver dysfunction than AC. These results may 
      provide putative biomarkers for the prognosis of fatty liver disorder following 
      treatment with AC and AR extracts.

TI  - Osteomeles schwerinae extracts inhibits the binding to receptors of advanced 
      glycation end products and TGF-β1 expression in mesangial cells under diabetic 
      conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteomeles schwerinae C. K. Schneid. (Rosaceae, OSSC) is a medicinal 
      plant traditionally used to treat various diseases in Asia. The chemical 
      constituents of OSSC have an inhibitory effect on aldose reductase activity, 
      which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. However, 
      the protective effects of the pharmacological activity and potential mechanisms 
      in diabetic nephropathy are still not known. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, 
      OSSC extracts and major compounds were examined for their effects on binding to 
      the receptors of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and on transforming 
      growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) expression-related signal mechanisms in mouse 
      glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A simple, rapid and 
      efficient method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the marker 
      compounds in the ethanol extract of the leaves and twigs of OSSC using HPLC-diode 
      array detector (DAD). In this study, we determined the effects of OSSC extract 
      and hyperoside on AGE and RAGE binding, and studied the mechanism of OSSC extract 
      effects on AGE-bovine serum albumin (BSA)-treated GMCs. GMCs overexpressing human 
      RAGE were cultured in AGE-BSA labeled with Alexa 488, and OSSC extract. AGE/RAGE 
      binding were measured using fluorescence (excitation 485 nm/emission 528 nm). 
      TGF-β1 protein expression levels were determined by western blot analyses. 
      RESULTS: OSSC extracts of leaves and twigs inhibited on AGE/RAGE binding and 
      TGF-β1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in GMCs. Furthermore, OSSC 
      extracts reduced the effects on AGE-BSA-induced reactive oxidative species (ROS) 
      formation and nuclear translocalization of transcription factor NF-κB. OSSC 
      extracts inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein 
      kinases1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK), and IκB. 
      Hyperoside also inhibited AGE/RAGE binding and ROS formation, and reduced TGF-β1 
      expression and IkB phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: OSSC extracts and hyperoside may 
      attenuate AGE/RAGE binding and expression of TGF-β1 by downregulating of pERK1/2, 
      p38MAPK and IκB phosphorylations in GMCs under diabetic condition and retard the 
      development of diabetic complications such as diabetic nephropathy.

PG  - 506-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2009.05.022 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Terminalia chebula has an esteemed origin in 
      Indian mythology; its fruits are used to treat many diseases such as digestive, 
      diabetes, colic pain, chronic cough, sore throat, asthma, etc. AIM OF THE STUDY: 
      The water or ethanolic extracts of the fruits were reported to have anti-oxidant, 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and radio-protector properties. The present study 
      is to isolate and identify the compounds that inhibit COX and 5-LOX, the key 
      enzymes involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      ethanolic extract of the fruits was fractionated by RP-HPLC and fractions were 
      tested for enzyme inhibition activity against COX and 5-LOX. One of the 
      fractionated compounds showed potent dual inhibition against COX and 5-LOX. It 
      was identified as chebulagic acid by LC-MS, NMR and IR analyses. The chebulagic 
      acid was also tested for anti-proliferative activity. RESULTS: Chebulagic acid 
      showed potent COX-LOX dual inhibition activity with IC(50) values of 15+/-0.288, 
      0.92+/-0.011 and 2.1+/-0.057 microM for COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX respectively. It 
      also showed anti-proliferative activity against HCT-15, COLO-205, MDA-MB-231, 
      DU-145 and K562 cell lines. Further mechanistic studies on COLO-205 cells 
      revealed induction of apoptosis by chebulagic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Chebulagic acid, 
      a COX-2 and 5-LOX dual inhibitor isolated from the fruits of Terminalia chebula, 
      induces apoptosis in COLO-205 cells.

TI  - Amelioration of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C₂C₁₂ muscle cells by 
      rooibos (Aspalathus linearis).
PG  - 813-9
LID - S0944-7113(13)00127-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.phymed.2013.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Increased levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), specifically saturated free fatty 
      acids such as palmitate are associated with insulin resistance of muscle, fat and 
      liver. Skeletal muscle, responsible for up to 80% of the glucose disposal from 
      the peripheral circulation, is particularly vulnerable to increased levels of 
      saturated FFAs. Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and its unique dihydrochalcone 
      C-glucoside, aspalathin, shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic rats, could 
      play a role in preventing or ameliorating the development of insulin resistance. 
      This study aims to establish whether rooibos can ameliorate 
      experimentally-induced insulin-resistance in C₂C₁₂ skeletal muscle cells. 
      Palmitate-induced insulin resistant C₂C₁₂ cells were treated with an 
      aspalathin-enriched green (unfermented) rooibos extract (GRE), previously shown 
      for its blood glucose lowering effect in vitro and in vivo or an aqueous extract 
      of fermented rooibos (FRE). Glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity were 
      measured using 2-deoxy-[³H]-D-glucose, MTT and ATP assays, respectively. 
      Expression of proteins relevant to glucose metabolism was analysed by Western 
      blot. GRE contained higher levels of all compounds, except the enolic 
      phenylpyruvic acid-2-O-glucoside and luteolin-7-O-glucoside. Both rooibos 
      extracts increased glucose uptake, mitochondrial activity and ATP production. 
      Compared to FRE, GRE was more effective at increasing glucose uptake and ATP 
      production. At a mechanistic level both extracts down-regulated PKC θ activation, 
      which is associated with palmitate-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, the 
      extracts increased activation of key regulatory proteins (AKT and AMPK) involved 
      in insulin-dependent and non-insulin regulated signalling pathways. Protein 
      levels of the glucose transporter (GLUT4) involved in glucose transport via these 
      two pathways were also increased. This in vitro study therefore confirms that 
      rooibos can ameliorate palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C₂C₁₂ skeletal 
      muscle cells. Inhibition of PKC θ activation and increased activation of AMPK and 
      AKT offer a plausible mechanistic explanation for this ameliorative effect.

TI  - [Effect of tangshen formula on phospholipids metabolism in diabetic nephropathy 
      patients].
PG  - 780-6
AB  - This study was to report the effect of Tangshen Formula on phospholipids 
      metabolism in diabetic nephropathy patients. A normal phase-HPLC-TOF/MS method 
      was used in this study for the determination of seven species of phospholipids in 
      human plasma. Then, the concentration changes of potential phospholipids 
      biomarkers were discussed in diabetic nephropathy phase III and phase IV patients 
      among different groups, including before and 3, 6 months after administration of 
      Tangshen Formula. Significant increases of PE750, PI885, PC792, PC826, PC830, 
      PC854 and PC802 levels were observed 6 months after administration of Tangshen 
      Formula and conventional western medicine, as well as a decrease of LPC540 level, 
      when compared with those before medication. Concentrations of all the potential 
      phospholipids biomarkers showed a tendency towards normal levels; however, both 
      the improvement degree and onset time of these compounds were not same. 
      Additionally, Tangshen Formula treatment based on conventional western medicine 
      treatment was more efficient in adjusting the levels of these compounds when 
      compared with western medicine treatment alone, especially for the phase IV 
      patients. These results indicated that Tangshen Formula was capable in regulating 
      and improving phospholipids metabolism in diabetic nephropathy patients, which 
      may be related with the direct or indirect inhibition of protein kinase C pathway 
      and the corresponding reduction of phospholipase A2 activity. Therefore, Tangshen 
      Formula may be used as an effective drug for diabetic nephropathy therapy, at 
      least as an adjunctive therapeutic drug.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistin (Retn) is a cytokine which has a controversial physiological 
      role regarding its involvement with obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. 
      Recently, murine Retn was found to be a possibly potential regulator of 
      hematopoiesis in mice shown in the screening results of a set of gene chips which 
      mapped the expression level of murine genes during regeneration of impaired bone 
      marrow (BM) by 5-fluorouracil. RESULTS: Recombinant mice Retn was expressed in 
      Escherichia coli and purified using ion exchange chromatography. Totally 11.4 mg 
      rmRetn was obtained from 500 ml culture with endotoxin level less than 1.0 EU/ug. 
      The purity of recombinant murine Resistin reached to at least 97.6% via SDS-PAGE 
      analysis and HPLC. The protein possessed chemotaxis effects in the mouse aortic 
      endothelial cells in vitro in transwell analysis. In vitro, rmRetn could up 
      regulate the CFU number of mice BM and after rmRetn was administered, the cell 
      number of murine bone marrow was significantly increased in vivo after 
      chemotherapy. Finally, rmRetn was found able to protect mice from the 
      chemotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery demonstrated a new 
      function of murine Retn and suggested that it could potentially accelerate bone 
      marrow regeneration post chemotherapy.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Oryeongsan (ORS, Wulingsan) has been reported to 
      possess renal protective effects from renal diseases such as diabetes-induced 
      renal damage, and nephrocalcinosis. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to 
      evaluate the quantitative analysis and the inhibitory effect of ORS on hypertonic 
      stress-induced water channel and apoptosis in murine inner medullary collecting 
      duct cell line (mIMCD-3). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromatographic and NMR 
      spectroscopic analysis were performed and water balance regulation was determined 
      by Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescnece. RESULTS: Seven active principles 
      (5-hydroxymethylfurfural, alismoxide, methyl(-)trans-cinnamate, adenine, 
      guanosine, adenosine, and ferulic acid) in ORS were isolated and the structures 
      were identified mainly by NMR spectroscopic analysis. In addition, contents of 
      these metabolites in ORS were evaluated by HPLC analysis. Pretreatment with ORS 
      significantly attenuated the hypertonic stress (175mM NaCl)-induced increase in 
      protein levels of AQP2 and apical membrane insertion. ORS also attenuated 
      osmolyte sodium-myo-inositol transporter (SMIT) expression and 
      tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) mRNA under hypertonic 
      stress. Those actions of ORS presented the similar effect of PKA inhibitor which 
      AQP2 expression throughout the inhibition of vasopressin-mediated cAMP/PKA signal 
      pathway. On the other hand, pretreatment with ORS attenuated hypertonic 
      stress-induced cell death. Hypertonic stress-induced Bax or caspase-3 expression 
      was decreased by ORS, resulting in anti-apoptotic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present data suggest that the beneficial effect of ORS in water balance and 
      apoptosis against hypertonic stress of renal collecting ducts.

TI  - Fucoxanthin, a Marine Xanthophyll Isolated From Conticribra weissflogii ND-8: 
      Preventive Anti-Inflammatory Effect in a Mouse Model of Sepsis.
PG  - 906
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2019.00906 [doi]
LID - 906
AB  - Background: Fucoxanthin (FX), a xanthophyll pigment which occurs in marine brown 
      algae with remarkable biological properties, has been proven to be safe for 
      consumption by animals. Although FX has various pharmacological effects including 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, 
      anti-malarial, and anti-lipid, in vivo protective effect against sepsis has not 
      been reported. In this study, we aimed at evaluation the efficacy of the FX in a 
      model of sepsis mouse. Methods: FX was successfully isolated from Conticribra 
      weissflogii ND-8 for the first time. The FX was identified by thin-layer 
      chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Animals were randomly divided 
      into 9 groups, including Sham group (mouse received an intraperitoneal injection 
      of normal saline 1.0 ml/kg), FX-treated (0.1-1.0 ml/kg), Lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS)-treated (20 mg/kg), FX+LPS-treated (0.1-10.0 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, 
      respectively), and urinastatin groups (10(4) U/kg). Nuclear factor (NF)-κB 
      activation could be potential treatment for sepsis. NF-κB signaling components 
      were determined by western-blotting. IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α production, and NF-κB 
      activation were evaluated by ELISA and immunofluorescent staining in vitro. 
      Results: FX was found to decrease the expression of inflammatory cytokines 
      including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, in a prophylactic manner in the LPS-induced 
      sepsis mouse model. Meanwhile, FX significantly inhibits phosphorylation of the 
      NF-κB signaling pathway induced by LPS at the cellular level and reduces the 
      nuclear translocation of NF-κB. The IC(50) for suppressing the expression of 
      NF-κB was 11.08 ± 0.78 μM in the THP1-Lucia™ NF-κB cells. Furthermore, FX also 
      inhibits the expression of inflammatory factors in a dose-dependent manner with 
      the IC(50) inhibition of IL-6 production was 2.19 ± 0.70 μM in Raw267.4 
      macrophage cells. It is likely that the molecules with the ability of targeting 
      NF-κB activation and inflammasome assembly, such as fucoxanthin, are interesting 
      subjects to be used for treating sepsis.

      METHODS: The information about active components of C-DM1 extract and molecular 
      mechanism was obtained from network pharmacology analysis. Main compounds of 
      C-DM1 extract by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      (HPLC-MS) analysis were conducted for quality control. For in vivo study, mice 
      were induced diabetes by HFD for 12 weeks. The mice in the normal group (Nor) 
      were maintained with a regular diet and treated with saline by gavage. The HFD 
      model mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, including a HFD diabetic model 
      group, a C-DM1 extract-administered group (C-DM1, 500 mg/kg), and 
      metformin-administered groups (Met, 500 mg/kg), 8 mice in each group. Food 
      intake, body weight (BW), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were recorded 
      weekly for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (LDL-C) were determined using an automated clinical chemistry 
      analyzer, and homeostatic model for assessing insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels 
      and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were detected. The histopathological 
      changes of liver and pancreatic tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin 
      staining. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/ 
      protein kinase B (AKT) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
      (AMPK) expressions in liver and pancreas tissues were detected by Western blot 
      analysis. RESULTS: HPLC-MS identified dihydroisotanshinone, dihydroisotanshinone 
      I, cryptotanshinone, harpagoside, and atractyloside A in C-DM1 extract. The 
      administration of C-DM1 extract significantly decreased body weight, calorie 
      intake, and the levels of blood glucose and insulin in the diabetic mice (P<0.05 
      or P<0.01). The C-DM1 extract administration improved the impaired glucose 
      tolerance and insulin resistance in the diabetic mice and significantly decreased 
      the levels of LDL-C, ALT and AST (P<0.01). The C-DM1 extract inhibited the 
      histopathological changes of fatty liver and hyperplasia of pancreatic islets in 
      the diabetic mice. The C-DM1 extract significantly increased the phosphorylation 
      of IRS, AKT, and AMPK and the expression of PI3K in pancreas and liver tissues 
      (P<0.05 or P<0.01), which was consistent with the analysis results of network 
      pharmacology. CONCLUSION: C-DM1 extract improved diabetes symptoms in long-term 
      HFD-induced mice by regulation of IRS/PI3K/AKT and AMPK expressions in pancreas 
      and liver tissues, suggesting that C-DM1 formulation may help prevent the 
      progression of T2DM.

AB  - PURPOSE: RPE65 gene knockout (Rpe65⁻/⁻) mice showed abolished isomerohydrolase 
      activity in the visual cycle and were considered a model for vitamin A deficiency 
      in the retina. The purpose of this study was to compare the retinal phenotypes 
      between vitamin A-deficient (VAD) mice and Rpe65⁻/⁻ mice under normal diet. 
      METHODS: The VAD mice were fed with a vitamin A-deprived diet after birth. The 
      age-matched control mice and Rpe65⁻/⁻ mice were maintained under normal diet. The 
      structure of photoreceptor outer segment was compared using electron microscopy. 
      Photoreceptor-specific gene expression was determined using real-time RT-PCR. The 
      isomerohydrolase and lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) activities were 
      measured using an in vitro enzymatic activity assay. Endogenous retinoid profiles 
      were analyzed by HPLC in mouse eyecup homogenates. RESULTS: Compared to wild-type 
      mice under normal diet, scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that 
      the outer segments of photoreceptors were disorganized in VAD mice and were not 
      disorganized in Rpe65⁻/⁻ mice, although they were shortened in the latter. VAD 
      mice showed more prominent downregulation of middle wavelength cone opsin, 
      whereas Rpe65⁻/⁻ mice displayed more suppressed expression of short wavelength 
      cone opsin. In vitro enzymatic activity assay and Western blot analysis showed 
      that vitamin A deprivation downregulated LRAT expression and activity in the 
      eyecup, but Rpe65⁻/⁻ mice showed unchanged LRAT expression and activity. The 
      depressed LRAT activity in VAD mice was partially rescued by the intraperitoneal 
      injection of retinoic acid. CONCLUSIONS: VAD and Rpe65⁻/⁻ mice are different in 
      cone photoreceptor degeneration, photoreceptor-specific gene regulation, 
      isomerohydrolase activity, endogenous retinoid profile, and LRAT activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous metabolic pathways have been implicated in diabetes-induced 
      renal injury, yet few studies have utilized unbiased systems biology approaches 
      for mapping the interconnectivity of diabetes-dysregulated proteins that are 
      involved. We utilized a global, quantitative, differential proteomic approach to 
      identify a novel retinoic acid hub in renal cortical protein networks 
      dysregulated by type 2 diabetes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total proteins 
      were extracted from renal cortex of control and db/db mice at 20 weeks of age 
      (after 12 weeks of hyperglycemia in the diabetic mice). Following trypsinization, 
      (18)O- and (16)O-labeled control and diabetic peptides, respectively, were pooled 
      and separated by two dimensional liquid chromatography (strong cation exchange 
      creating 60 fractions further separated by nano-HPLC), followed by peptide 
      identification and quantification using mass spectrometry. Proteomic analysis 
      identified 53 proteins with fold change >or=1.5 and p<or=0.05 after 
      Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment (out of 1,806 proteins identified), including 
      alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH1/ALDH1A1). 
      Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified altered retinoic acid as a key signaling 
      hub that was altered in the diabetic renal cortical proteome. Western blotting 
      and real-time PCR confirmed diabetes-induced upregulation of RALDH1, which was 
      localized by immunofluorescence predominantly to the proximal tubule in the 
      diabetic renal cortex, while PCR confirmed the downregulation of ADH identified 
      with mass spectrometry. Despite increased renal cortical tissue levels of retinol 
      and RALDH1 in db/db versus control mice, all-trans-retinoic acid was 
      significantly decreased in association with a significant decrease in 
      PPARbeta/delta mRNA. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that retinoic 
      acid metabolism is significantly dysregulated in diabetic kidneys, and suggest 
      that a shift in all-trans-retinoic acid metabolism is a novel feature in type 2 
      diabetic renal disease. Our observations provide novel insights into potential 
      links between altered lipid metabolism and other gene networks controlled by 
      retinoic acid in the diabetic kidney, and demonstrate the utility of using 
      systems biology to gain new insights into diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - In Vitro Antidiabetic and Antioxidant Effects of Different Extracts of 
      Catharanthus roseus and Its Indole Alkaloid, Vindoline.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25235546 [doi]
LID - 5546
AB  - The Catharanthus roseus plant has been used traditionally to treat diabetes 
      mellitus. Scientific evidence supporting the antidiabetic effects of this plant's 
      active ingredient-vindoline has not been fully evaluated. In this study, extracts 
      of C. roseus and vindoline were tested for antioxidant activities, alpha amylase 
      and alpha glucosidase inhibitory activities and insulin secretory effects in 
      pancreatic RIN-5F cell line cultured in the absence of glucose, at low and high 
      glucose concentrations. The methanolic extract of the plant showed the highest 
      antioxidant activities in addition to the high total polyphenolic content (p < 
      0.05). The HPLC results exhibited increased concentration of vindoline in the 
      dichloromethane and the ethylacetate extracts. Vindoline showed noticeable 
      antioxidant activity when compared to ascorbic acid at p < 0.05 and significantly 
      improved the in vitro insulin secretion. The intracellular reactive oxygen 
      species formation in glucotoxicity-induced cells was significantly reduced 
      following treatment with vindoline, methanolic and the dichloromethane extracts 
      when compared to the high glucose untreated control (p < 0.05). Plant extracts 
      and vindoline showed weaker inhibitory effects on the activities of carbohydrate 
      metabolizing enzymes when compared to acarbose, which inhibited the activities of 
      the enzymes by 80%. The plant extracts also exhibited weak alpha amylase and 
      alpha glucosidase inhibitory effects.

TI  - Chromatographic quantitation of plasma and erythrocyte pentosidine in diabetic 
      and uremic subjects.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - Pentosidine is a fluorescent advanced Maillard/glycosylation product and protein 
      cross-link present in elevated amounts in skin from diabetic and uremic subjects. 
      A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay was developed to 
      quantitate pentosidine in plasma and erythrocytes and other tissue proteins with 
      low levels of pentosidine. High protein content and presence of basic amino acids 
      and O2 during acid hydrolysis led to the formation of fluorescent artifacts that 
      could be separated from true pentosidine through combined reverse-phase 
      ion-exchange HPLC. No true pentosidine was formed during acid hydrolysis of 
      ribated protein, suggesting that Amadori products do not generate artifactual 
      pentosidine during hydrolysis. With the combined reverse-phase ion-exchange 
      chromatographic assay, we found a 2.5-fold (P less than 0.001) and a 23-fold (P 
      less than 0.001) elevation of mean +/- SD plasma protein pentosidine in diabetic 
      (2.4 +/- 1.2 pmol/mg) and uremic (21.5 +/- 10.8 pmol/mg) subjects compared with 
      healthy (0.95 +/- 0.33 pmol/mg) subjects. Pentosidine in hemolysate was normal in 
      diabetes but dramatically elevated in uremia (0.6 +/- 0.4 pmol/mg hemoglobin, P 
      less than 0.001). Although the precise nature of the pentosidine precursor sugar 
      is unknown, plasma pentosidine may be a useful marker for monitoring the 
      biochemical efficacy of trials with aminoguanidine or other treatment modalities. 
      Furthermore, pentosidine in plasma proteins may act as a signal for advanced 
      glycosylation end product-mediated receptor uptake by macrophages and other cells 
      and contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes and uremia.

TI  - Antihyperglycemic effect of Cephalotaxus sinensis leaves and GLUT-4 translocation 
      facilitating activity of its flavonoid constituents.
PG  - 1123-9
AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the antihyperglycemic effect of 
      Cephalotaxus sinensis leaves and to identify the active components. The 
      antihyperglycemic effect of various fractions (FA, FB, FC, FD) of the 80% ethanol 
      extract of the leaves was evaluated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic 
      rats. Among the tested fractions, FC was the most active. FC (0.48 g/kg) given 
      orally for 10 d reduced significantly (p<0.001) the blood glucose of STZ-induced 
      diabetic rats. The food and water intakes of FC (0.48 g/kg)-treated diabetic rats 
      were reduced significantly (p<0.001) when compared to the 0.5% carboxymethyl 
      cellulose (CMC)-treated diabetic rats. The activity-guided fractionation of the 
      ethanol extract of C. sinensis leaves furnished three flavonoid compounds, 
      apigenin-5-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-6-O-beta-D-acetylglucopyranoside] 
      (1), apigenin (2), and 
      apigenin-5-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-6-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside] (3). 
      The elevation of GLUT-4 protein level in membrane preparations from mice 
      adipocytes was detected by Western blot analysis after adipocytes were 
      pre-incubated with FC (0.1, 1, 10 mg/ml), apigenin (0.1, 2 mg/ml) and 
      apigenin-5-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-6-O-beta-D-acetylglucopyranoside] 
      (0.1, 2 mg/ml), respectively. Phytochemical investigation and HPLC-DAD analysis 
      of FC indicated that the flavonoids were the major constituents in this fraction. 
      These results suggest that the fraction from C. sinensis leaves is a promising 
      drug for the treatment of diabetes, and that the flavonoids from this plant are 
      the active constituents.

TI  - A Moderately High-Fat Diet with Proper Nutrient Quality Improves Glucose 
      Homeostasis, Linked to Downregulation of Intestinal CD36 Mediated by the Loss of 
      Desulfovibrio.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.4c05695 [doi]
AB  - The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has become a major public 
      health challenge. Dietary intervention is a cornerstone of diabetes management, 
      yet the optimal macronutrient composition remains an open question. In this 
      study, mice were fed a western (W) diet, a moderately high-fat (MHF) diet, a 
      high-protein-high-carbohydrate (HPHC) diet, or a high-protein-low-carbohydrate 
      (HPLC) diet for 22 weeks to compare the effects of different dietary patterns on 
      glucose homeostasis. Our results showed that a MHF diet, under consistent 
      nutrient quality, was most beneficial for glucose metabolism. The MHF diet 
      reduced two key inducers of diabetes─lipid accumulation and inflammation. 
      Downregulation of intestinal CD36 induced by loss of Desulfovibrio colonization 
      restrained lipid absorption and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transport, which played 
      a crucial role in MHF-mediated resistance to lipid accumulation and inflammation. 
      The findings endorse a dietary pattern featuring MHF of appropriate nutrient 
      quality as an effective strategy for diabetes management.

AB  - We describe a simplified approach for purification and characterization of human 
      'IgG-Fc' fragment used widely as immunochemical tool and for therapeutic 
      purposes. The 'Fc' fragment was purified from human IgG in a 3-stage column 
      chromatography. The purified 'Fc' fragment appeared as a dimer glycoprotein with 
      an apparent molecular mass of 52,981 Dalton (Ultraflex MALDI TOF/TOF). The 
      Size-exclusion HPLC profile of the purified 'Fc' fragment of human IgG matched 
      that of a commercially procured reference 'Fc' fragment material. The purity of 
      the 'Fc' fragments was >99% by SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion HPLC. The results of 
      Western blotting, immunoelectrophoresis, and mass spectrometry analysis indicate 
      a high purity of the 'Fc' fragment. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis of the 
      purified 'Fc' protein yielded peptides that partially match the known database 
      sequences of FCG3B_HUMAN (Uniprot ID: O75015). This method of purification of the 
      'Fc' fragment is suitable for achieving high purity level of 'Fc' fragment 
      protein. With this purification approach, the cost of the purified 'Fc' fragment 
      of human IgG is significantly reduced as compared with the current market price 
      of IgG-Fc fragment protein in international market. The purified 'IgG-Fc' 
      fragment protein was found to be negative for major viral markers.

TI  - Amino acids potentiate insulin signaling in CHO-K1 at high glucose conditions.
PG  - 173-82
LID - 10.1016/j.arcmed.2012.04.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Amino acids reportedly increase the glucose uptake under 
      high glucose conditions. However, there are controversies in the role of amino 
      acids in diabetes mellitus. The present study explores the insulin signaling 
      pathway involved in glucose uptake mediated by amino acids in CHO-K1 cells. 
      METHODS: CHO-K1 cells were exposed to normal (7 mM) and high glucose (17 and 27 
      mM) with 100 nM insulin in the presence and absence of amino acid mixtures (AAM) 
      in varying concentration (5 and 20 mM) followed by the assays, insulin receptor 
      tyrosine kinase (IRTK) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) by 
      autoradiography, protein kinase B (Akt) and glucose transporter (GLUT4) by 
      Western blot and glycogen synthase (GS) by HPLC. RESULTS: The addition of 5 and 
      20 mM AAM significantly increased IRTK and PI3K activity (ANOVA p = 0.025, p = 
      0.003, respectively) with increasing glucose concentration. Addition of 5 mM AAM 
      in the presence of normal glucose significantly increased the levels of 
      phosphorylated Akt Ser473 (p = 0.02) with no significant change at high glucose. 
      At 20 mM AAM there was a significant decrease in Akt phosphorylation (p = 0.035) 
      that was increased by high glucose concentration. GLUT4 protein levels were 
      increased with AAM (5 mM) along with increase in glycogen synthase activity at 
      all glucose concentrations (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Amino acids as a mixture is 
      beneficial in augmenting insulin signaling pathway via IRTK/PI3K/GLUT4 pathway 
      along with activation of GS in CHO-K1 cells, thereby ensuring increased 
      intracellular glucose availability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to upregulate GTP 
      cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH-I), the key enzyme for tetrahydrobiopterin de novo 
      synthesis and to normalize tetrahydrobiopterin levels in hyperglycemic 
      endothelial cells. We sought to determine whether in vivo treatment with the 
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin is able to upregulate the GTPCH-I, to 
      recouple eNOS and to normalize endothelial dysfunction in an experimental model 
      of diabetes mellitus. METHODS AND RESULTS: In male Wistar rats, diabetes was 
      induced by streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). In STZ rats, atorvastatin feeding (20 
      mg/kg/d, 7 weeks), normalized vascular dysfunction as analyzed by isometric 
      tension studies, levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells 
      (FACS-analysis), superoxide formation (assessed by lucigenin-enhanced 
      chemiluminescence and dihydroethidium staining), vascular levels of the 
      phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (P-VASP), tyrosine nitration 
      of the prostacyclin synthase, expression of GTPCH-I, dihydrofolate reductase and 
      eNOS, translocation of regulatory NADPH oxidase subunits rac1, p47phox and 
      p67phox (assessed by Western blot) and vascular tetrahydrobiopterin levels as 
      measured by HPLC. Dihydroethidine staining revealed that the reduction of 
      vascular superoxide was at least in part due to eNOS recoupling. CONCLUSION: 
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibition normalizes endothelial function and reduces 
      oxidative stress in diabetes by inhibiting activation of the vascular NADPH 
      oxidase and by preventing eNOS uncoupling due to an upregulation of the key 
      enzyme of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, GTPCH-I.

AB  - Recent investigations have demonstrated that elevated serum retinol-binding 
      protein 4 (RBP4) secreted from adipose tissue plays a role in the development of 
      systemic insulin resistance, and lowering RBP4 improves insulin sensitivity. 
      These observations provide a rationale for the development of new antidiabetic 
      agents aimed at reducing serum RBP4 concentrations. In this study, we sought to 
      determine whether retinoic acid (RA) administration decreases serum RBP4 and 
      suppresses insulin resistance in diabetic ob/ob mice. All-trans RA [100 
      mug/(moused) in corn oil] was administered by stomach intubation to a group of 
      ob/ob mice, with the control group receiving the vehicle for 16 d. Body weight 
      and food intake were monitored. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were 
      performed. We quantified serum RBP4 and retinol by Western blotting and HPLC, 
      respectively. RA treatment reduced body weight (P < 0.05), basal serum glucose (P 
      < 0.001), serum retinol (P < 0.01), and RBP4 (P < 0.05). It improved insulin 
      sensitivity and decreased the retinol:RBP4 ratio (P < 0.05). These studies 
      suggest that RA is an effective antidiabetic agent that could be considered in 
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Insulin intake is recommended for diabetics in addition to a proper diet and 
      lifestyle to maintain adequate blood glucose level. Currently, there is a need 
      for an alternative expression system for insulin production as the current 
      expression systems may not meet the growing demand due to various constraints. 
      Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of human insulin in an unconventional 
      expression system based on Pseudomonas fluorescens, a BSL 1 bacterium. Human 
      insulin was produced in the form of proinsulin fused with fusion protein. Then, 
      the proinsulin fusion protein was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography and 
      converted into human insulin. The physicochemical parameters for producing 
      proinsulin fusion protein are optimized. Glucose and ammonium chloride are 
      determined to be suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The validity 
      of insulin and proinsulin fusion protein is assessed using western blot and 
      quantified using ELISA techniques. Up to 145.35 mg/l of the proinsulin fusion 
      protein is achieved at the shake flask level. Further, MALDI-TOF and RP-HPLC 
      analysis of the purified human insulin were observed to be close to the 
      theoretical value and insulin standard, respectively. The expression of the 
      recombinant fusion protein was found to be 214.7 mg/l in a batch bioreactor, 
      a ∼48% enhancement over the shake flask level. Further, kinetic modeling was 
      performed to understand the system regarding growth, substrate utilization and 
      product formation, and to estimate the various kinetic parameters. This study 
      establishes the potential of the P. fluorescens expression system for producing 
      human insulin.

TI  - Protein modification by methylglyoxal: chemical nature and synthetic mechanism of 
      a major fluorescent adduct.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - The nonenzymatic Maillard reaction of proteins, initiated by the addition of 
      sugars and other aldehydes and ketones, is thought to be an important mechanism 
      in aging and the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. The alpha-dicarbonyl 
      compounds are considered to be key intermediates in this reaction. Methylglyoxal 
      (MG) (pyruvaldehyde), a physiological alpha-dicarbonyl compound, has been shown 
      to modify proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Here we describe a novel 
      fluorescent pyrimidine, 
      N-delta-(5-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine-2-yl)-L-ornithine (argpyrimidine), 
      formed from the Maillard reaction of MG with N-alpha-t-BOC-arginine. We find that 
      the fluorescence spectrum of argpyrimidine is similar to that of 
      methylglyoxal-modified proteins, suggesting that it is a major product in such 
      modified proteins. HPLC-quantification of argpyrimidine in proteins incubated 
      with methylglyoxal revealed a time-dependent formation. We detected significant 
      amounts of argpyrimidine in incubations of N-alpha-t-BOC-arginine with micromolar 
      concentrations of MG, and we find that various sugars and ascorbic acid serve as 
      precursors. Our studies indicate that argpyrimidine is synthesized through an 
      intermediate 3-hydroxypentane-2,4-dione and provide a chemical basis for 
      fluorescence in proteins modified by methylglyoxal. We suggest that enhanced 
      intrinsic fluorescence in diabetic proteins may be due, in part, to 
      methylglyoxal-mediated Maillard reactions.

TI  - Palmitoylation of the glucose transporter in blood-brain barrier capillaries.
PG  - 191-6
AB  - Palmitoylation of GLUT1 was investigated in brain capillaries. The glucose 
      transporter was shown to be palmitoylated using [3H]palmitate labeling and 
      immunoprecipitation. The labeling was sensitive to methanolic KOH or 
      hydroxylamine hydrolysis, indicating the presence of an ester or thioester bond. 
      The released fatty acid was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and was identified as 
      [3H]palmitate. Specificity of the immunoprecipitation was assessed by competitive 
      inhibition of anti-GLUT1 binding with a synthetic C-terminal peptide against 
      which the antibody was raised. In vivo studies were performed using capillaries 
      isolated from control rats, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and diet-induced 
      hyperglycemic rats. Glycemia was increased 2- and 5-fold in the hyperglycemic and 
      diabetic groups, respectively. GLUT1 expression was evaluated in the three groups 
      by Western blot analysis. A 36% decrease in GLUT1 expression was observed in the 
      diabetic group, while there was no significant variation in GLUT1 expression in 
      the hyperglycemic group. Palmitoylation of GLUT1 was increased in both 
      diet-induced hyperglycemic and diabetic groups. These results suggest that 
      palmitoylation may be involved in the regulation of glucose transport activity in 
      hyperglycemia.

AB  - Diabetic vascular complications result from high-glucose induced vascular 
      endothelial cell dysfunction. There is an emerging need for novel drugs with 
      vascular endothelial cell protective effects for the treatment of diabetic 
      vascular complications. The present study aimed to investigate the protective 
      effect of α-mangostin against high-glucose induced apoptosis of cultured human 
      umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were treated with glucose to 
      induce apoptosis. The expression of the apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, 
      and cleaved caspase-3, were detected by Western blotting. Ceramide concentration 
      and acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity were assayed by HPLC. The cell apoptosis 
      rate was detected by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V/propidium 
      iodide (PI). Compared with HUVECs cultured in 5 mM glucose, cells cultured in 30 
      mM glucose exhibited a higher apoptosis rate, up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 
      and Bax (proapoptotic proteins), down-regulation of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic 
      protein), increased ceramide concentration, and enhanced ASM activity (all 
      P<0.05). α-Mangostin (15 µM) significantly attenuated the high-glucose induced 
      increase in apoptosis rate (8.64 ± 2.16 compared with 19.6 ± 3.54%), 
      up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, elevation 
      of ceramide level, and enhancement of ASM activity (all P<0.05). The effects of 
      desipramine were similar to those of α-mangostin. The protective effect of 
      α-mangostin on high-glucose induced apoptotic damage may be mediated by an 
      inhibition of ASM and thus a decreased level of ceramide.

AB  - Passiflora edulis Var. flavicarpa (passion fruit) generates vast waste (60-70%) 
      in the form of peel and seed after the juice extraction. The study aimed to 
      isolate Scirpusin B (SB) from passion fruit (PF) seed waste collected from 
      Northeast India and to analyse its anti-radical, antibacterial, anti-diabetic, 
      and anti-oral cancer activities. Scirpusin B was isolated following 
      hydro-alcoholic extraction, fractionation, and column chromatography. The 
      isolated fraction was further identified through NMR and mass spectroscopy. SB 
      exhibited significant antiradical activity against six standard antioxidant 
      compounds, indicating its commercial application. SB inhibited α-amylase (IC(50) 
      Value: 76.38 ± 0.25 µg/mL) and α-glucosidase digestive enzymes (IC(50) Value: 
      2.32 ± 0.04 µg/mL), signifying its antidiabetic properties. In addition, SB 
      showed profound antibacterial activity against eight gram-positive and 
      gram-negative bacteria reported for the first time. Furthermore, SB inhibited SAS 
      and TTN oral cancer cell proliferation up to 95% and 83%, respectively. SB 
      significantly inhibited colonies of SAS and TTn cells in the clonogenic assay, 
      attributing to its anticancer properties. The PI-FACS assay confirmed the ability 
      of SB (75 µM) to kill SAS and TTn cells by 40.26 and 44.3% in 72 h. The mechanism 
      of SB inhibiting oral cancer cell proliferation was understood through western 
      blot analysis, where SB significantly suppressed different cancer hallmark 
      proteins, such as TNF-α, survivin, COX-2, cyclin D1, and VEGF-A. The present 
      study suggests that SB isolated from PF seed can add noteworthy value to the 
      waste biomass for various industrial and medical applications. SUPPLEMENTARY

TI  - A beta cell ATGL-lipolysis/adipose tissue axis controls energy homeostasis and 
      body weight via insulin secretion in mice.
PG  - 2654-2663
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To directly assess the role of beta cell lipolysis in insulin 
      secretion and whole-body energy homeostasis, inducible beta cell-specific adipose 
      triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-deficient (B-Atgl-KO) mice were studied under normal 
      diet (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. METHODS: Atgl (flox/flox) mice were 
      cross-bred with Mip-Cre-ERT mice to generate Mip-Cre-ERT(/+);Atgl (flox/flox) 
      mice. At 8 weeks of age, these mice were injected with tamoxifen to induce 
      deletion of beta cell-specific Atgl (also known as Pnpla2), and the mice were fed 
      an ND or HFD. RESULTS: ND-fed male B-Atgl-KO mice showed decreased insulinaemia 
      and glucose-induced insulin secretion (GSIS) in vivo. Changes in GSIS correlated 
      with the islet content of long-chain saturated monoacylglycerol (MAG) species 
      that have been proposed to be metabolic coupling factors for insulin secretion. 
      Exogenous MAGs restored GSIS in B-Atgl-KO islets. B-Atgl-KO male mice fed an HFD 
      showed reduced insulinaemia, glycaemia in the fasted and fed states and after 
      glucose challenge, as well as enhanced insulin sensitivity. Moreover, decreased 
      insulinaemia in B-Atgl-KO mice was associated with increased energy expenditure, 
      and lipid metabolism in brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues, leading to 
      reduced fat mass and body weight. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: ATGL in beta cells 
      regulates insulin secretion via the production of signalling MAGs. Decreased 
      insulinaemia due to lowered GSIS protects B-Atgl-KO mice from diet-induced 
      obesity, improves insulin sensitivity, increases lipid mobilisation from WAT and 
      causes BAT activation. The results support the concept that fuel excess can drive 
      obesity and diabetes via hyperinsulinaemia, and that an islet beta cell 
      ATGL-lipolysis/adipose tissue axis controls energy homeostasis and body weight 
      via insulin secretion.

AB  - Compound K (CK) is a final intestinal metabolite of protopanaxadiol-type 
      ginsenosides from Panax ginseng and shows various bioactivities. Although it has 
      also been found to have the property of anti-diabetes, the long-term effect of CK 
      on insulin secretion in β-cells is still unclear. In this study, CK was prepared 
      from ginsenoside Rd by snailase hydrolysis and its effect on the insulin 
      secretion activity in MIN6 pancreatic β-cell lines in vitro was assessed. The 
      expression of glucose transporter isoform-2 (GLUT2) and the cellular ATP content 
      were also examined by western blot and HPLC analysis, respectively. The results 
      showed that CK significantly enhanced insulin secretion, increased cellular ATP 
      content, and upregulated the expression of GLUT2. These findings indicate that CK 
      exerts prominent stimulatory effects on insulin secretion in the MIN6 cells 
      partly via upregulating the expression of GLUT2.

TI  - [Effects of flavonoids from Pyrrosiae folium on pathological changes and 
      inflammatory response of diabetic nephropathy].

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is closely related to immune-mediated inflammatory 
      damage. Pyrrosiae folium is used commonly for the urinary system diseases with a 
      good efficacy, which contains abundant flavonoids (SWHT). This study was 
      performed to investigate the therapeutic effect of SWHT on DN and its effect on 
      inflammatory response. In this study, the main active components of SWHT were 
      identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed 
      that SWHT mainly contained mangiferin and isomucoside. Rat model of diabetic 
      nephropathy (DN) was established by feeding high glucose & high fat diet and 
      injecting streptozocin (STZ). Then the rats were randomly divided into control 
      group, DN model group, positive control group, and SWHT groups (50, 100, 200 
      mg·kg⁻¹, ig). The levels of AGEs and RAGE in serum were measured by ELISA after 
      12 weeks of drug administration. The serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and 
      total protein levels were detected by using test kit. HE staining and 
      transmission electron microscopy were applied to observe the pathological changes 
      and structure of renal tissue. Western blot and ELISA were used to detect the 
      protein expression and content levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis 
      factor (TNF-α) and IL-1β in renal tissue. Results showed that SWHT significantly 
      decreased serum AGEs and RAGE levels in DN rats; decreased serum creatinine, 
      blood urea nitrogen and total urinary protein levels, improved renal pathological 
      damages and reduced basement membrane thickening in DN rats. In addition, SWHT 
      down-regulated the protein expression levels of inflammatory mediators IL-6, 
      TNF-α and IL-1β. The research studies indicated that SWHT component had a 
      potential anti-diabetic nephropathy activity, and its improvement effect on 
      pathological damages may be related to reducing inflammation. This provides the 
      basis for the scientific and rational application of P. folium, and also provides 
      active components for further development of Chinese medicine for diabetic 
      nephropathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Southern Schisandra is the dried and matured fruit of Schisandra 
      sphenanthera Rehd. et Wils. in the family of Magnoliaceae; Traditional medicine 
      reports that Schisandra sphenanthera has astringent and astringent properties, 
      benefiting qi and promoting the production of body fluid, tranquilising the heart 
      and calming the mind; it is clinically utilized for prolonged cough, thirst due 
      to injury of the body fluid, internal heat and thirst, palpitation and insomnia, 
      etc., and thirst belongs to the category of diabetes mellitus; the literature 
      reports and the preliminary study of our team showed that Schisandra sphenanthera 
      can be used to prevent and control diabetes mellitus. PURPOSE: In the research, 
      we investigated the mechanism of action of SDP against T2DM by integrating 
      pharmacodynamics, endogenous metabolite assays and signalling pathways. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: UPLC-MS/MS was used to identify the chemical constituents. HPLC was 
      utilized to determine the content of eight lignan-like components in SDP. A T2DM 
      rat model was established by the combined induction of high-fat and high-sugar 
      feed and STZ, and the mechanism of action of SDP on T2DM was investigated by 
      using biochemical indices, Western blot analysis of protein expression, mRNA 
      expression, immunohistochemistry and endogenous metabolites. RESULTS: The 
      chemical components in SDP were determined by UPLC-MS/MS and HPLC, and 
      biochemical indicators determined that SDP has the effects of lowering blood 
      glucose, anti-glycolipid metabolism, and anti-oxidative stress, and is able to 
      restore pathological damage in the liver and pancreas, activate the PI3K/AKT, 
      AMPK/mTOR, and sweetness receptor signalling pathways, restore the sweetness 
      receptor mRNAs, and modulate the urinary compounds such as malic acid, 
      γ-aminobutyric acid, leucine, N-acetylaspartic acid and other compounds thereby 
      achieving the therapeutic effect of T2DM. CONCLUSION: SDP can ameliorate 
      diabetes-induced symptoms related to elevated blood glucose, dyslipidaemia, 
      elevated fasting insulin levels and impaired glucose tolerance in rats; the 
      anti-T2DM of SDP may be through the regulation of the sweet taste receptor 
      pathway, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway, which leads to 
      the development of a normal level and exerts an antidiabetic effect.

AB  - The metabolic syndrome is recognized as a cluster of disturbances associated with 
      obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Over the past two decades, the number 
      of people with the metabolic syndrome has increased at an alarming rate. This 
      increase is associated with the global epidemic of both obesity and diabetes. 
      Cardiovascular mortality is increased among diabetics and obesity-related 
      insulin-resistant patients, and obesity is currently recognized as independent 
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We aimed to establish the effects of a 
      short period of an altered diet on the heart using a rat model of 
      hyperphagia-induced obesity (diet supplemented with sucrose and condensed milk 
      for 8 weeks = DIO) compared to age-matched controls. Isolated, perfused hearts 
      were subjected to global or regional ischaemia/reperfusion. Function on 
      reperfusion was recorded and infarct size determined. A plasma lipid profile was 
      established via HPLC-based methods and proteins involved in metabolic signalling 
      determined either by western blotting or RT-PCR. 8 weeks of diet resulted in 
      whole-body but not myocardial insulin resistance, increased plasma triglyceride 
      and phospholipid levels as well as increased lipid peroxidation. Despite the 
      similar baseline function, hearts from DIO animals showed significantly poorer 
      postischaemic recovery than controls (41.9 % RPP recovery vs 57.9 %, P < 0.05, n 
      = 7-11/group) but surprisingly, smaller infarct size (24.95 ± 1.97 vs 47.26 ± 
      4.05 % of the area at risk, P < 0.005, n = 8/group). Basal phosphorylation of 
      PKB/Akt was elevated but IRS-1 and SERCA-2 expression severely downregulated. In 
      conclusion, after only 8 weeks of a slight change in diet, the rat heart shows 
      signs of metabolic remodelling. Some of these changes may be protective but 
      others may be detrimental and eventually lead to maladaptation.

TI  - Expression, purification and characterization of the authentic form of human 
      growth hormone receptor antagonist G120R-hGH obtained in Escherichia coli 
      periplasmic space.

AB  - The human growth hormone receptor antagonist G120R-hGH precludes dimerization of 
      GH and prolactin receptors and consequently JAK/STAT signaling. Some 
      modifications in this antagonist resulted in a drug specific for the GH receptor, 
      called Pegvisomant (Somavert(®)). However, the original G120R-hGH is usually 
      synthesized in bacterial cytoplasm as inclusion bodies, not being a commercial 
      product. The present work describes the synthesis and characterization of 
      G120R-hGH secreted into bacterial periplasm and obtained with a vector based on a 
      constitutive lambda-PL promoter. This antagonist can be useful for studies aiming 
      at investigating the effects of a simultaneous inhibition of GH and prolactin 
      signaling, as a potential anti-tumoral or anti-diabetic compound. G120R-hGH, 
      synthesized using the W3110 E. coli strain, showed a yield of 
      1.34 ± 0.24 μg/ml/A(600) (∼0.79 mg G120R-hGH/g of wet weight cells) after 
      cultivation at 30 °C up to 3 A(600) units and induction at 37 °C, for 6 h, with 
      final 4.3 ± 0.3 A(600). A laboratory scale purification was carried out using 
      three chromatographic steps with a total yield of 32%, reaching 98% purity. The 
      obtained protein was characterized by SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, Mass 
      spectrometry, RP-HPLC, HPSEC and in vitro proliferation bioassay. The 
      proliferation assay, based on Ba/F3-LLP cells, shows that G120R-hGH (100 ng/ml) 
      significantly inhibited (64%) the proliferative action of hGH (1 ng/ml). This is 
      the first time that G120R-hGH is synthesized in bacterial periplasmic space and 
      therefore correctly folded, without the initial methionine. The reasons for a 
      divergent efficacy for antagonizing hGH versus hPRL is currently unknown and 
      deserves further investigation.

TI  - Hydrogen sulfide releasing aspirin, ACS14, attenuates high glucose-induced 
      increased methylglyoxal and oxidative stress in cultured vascular smooth muscle 
      cells.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide is a gasotransmitter with vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory 
      properties. Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor anti-inflammatory 
      drug. ACS14 is a novel synthetic hydrogen sulfide releasing aspirin which 
      inhibits cyclooxygenase and has antioxidant effects. Methylglyoxal is a 
      chemically active metabolite of glucose and fructose, and a major precursor of 
      advanced glycation end products formation. Methylglyoxal is harmful when produced 
      in excess. Plasma methylglyoxal levels are significantly elevated in diabetic 
      patients. Our aim was to investigate the effects of ACS14 on methylglyoxal levels 
      in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. We used cultured rat aortic 
      vascular smooth muscle cells for the study. Methylglyoxal was measured by HPLC 
      after derivatization, and nitrite+nitrate with an assay kit. Western blotting was 
      used to determine NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
      (iNOS) protein expression. Dicholorofluorescein assay was used to measure 
      oxidative stress. ACS14 significantly attenuated elevation of intracellular 
      methylglyoxal levels caused by incubating cultured vascular smooth muscle cells 
      with methylglyoxal (30 µM) and high glucose (25 mM). ACS14, but not aspirin, 
      caused a significant attenuation of increase in nitrite+nitrate levels caused by 
      methylglyoxal or high glucose. ACS14, aspirin, and sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, 
      a hydrogen sulfide donor), all attenuated the increase in oxidative stress caused 
      by methylglyoxal and high glucose in cultured cells. ACS14 prevented the increase 
      in NOX4 expression caused by incubating the cultured VSMCs with MG (30 µM). 
      ACS14, aspirin and NaHS attenuated the increase in iNOS expression caused by high 
      glucose (25 mM). In conclusion, ACS14 has the novel ability to attenuate an 
      increase in methylglyoxal levels which in turn can reduce oxidative stress, 
      decrease the formation of advanced glycation end products and prevent many of the 
      known deleterious effects of elevated methylglyoxal. Thus, ACS14 has the 
      potential to be especially beneficial for diabetic patients pending further in 
      vivo studies.

TI  - Angiotensin II type 1-receptor mediated changes in heparan sulfate proteoglycans 
      in human SV40 transformed podocytes.
PG  - 33-40
AB  - In patients with diabetic nephropathy, glomerular staining for heparan sulfate 
      proteoglycans (HSPG) side chains and for agrin is decreased. In the present 
      study, the influence of angiotensin II (AngII) on the production of HSPG in SV40 
      transformed podocytes was investigated. SV40 transformed human podocytes were 
      cultivated with or without 1 microM AngII, and HSPG production was measured by 
      sequential DEAE-anion exchange chromatography and HPLC-DEAE separation. 
      Expression of agrin was studied by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot 
      analysis using specific mono- and polyclonal antibodies. DEAE separation of total 
      glycosaminoglycans (GAG) revealed a significant increase of GAG in the culture 
      supernatant and decrease in the cell and matrix layer when podocytes were 
      cultured for 72 h in the presence of AngII. This was particularly found for 
      HS-GAG. Qualitative analysis of HSPG, using gel filtration of HNO(2)-treated 
      fractions, showed that AngII treatment decreased N-sulfation of HS-GAG side 
      chains. Indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti-agrin polyclonal antibody 
      was strongly decreased after AngII stimulation. A reduction in agrin expression 
      in cell extracts could also be detected in Western blot analysis using an mAb. No 
      changes in agrin mRNA were found after AngII stimulation. It is concluded from 
      this study that AngII decreases the amount of HSPG on the cell surface and in the 
      extracellular matrix of podocytes. Because HSPG play a fundamental role in the 
      permselectivity of the glomerular basement membrane, these results thus may 
      explain at least partially the antiproteinuric effects of angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme inhibition in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Urinary Metabolomics Study of the Intervention Effect of Hypoglycemic Decoction

AB  - The hypoglycemic decoction (HD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
      preparation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), with a remarkable 
      therapeutic effect. However, its mechanism of action is still unclear at the 
      metabolic level. In this study, the biochemical markers from type 2 DM (T2DM) 
      rats, induced by a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin 
      (STZ), were detected. The metabolomics-based analysis using high-performance 
      liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was 
      conducted to evaluate urine samples from control, model, metformin, and HD 
      groups. After oral administration of HD for 28 days, the general state, weight, 
      fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid level, oral glucose tolerance test 
      (OGTT), fasting insulin (FINS), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and homeostasis 
      model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly improved (P < 
      0.01). The western blotting showed that HD can enhance the protein expression of 
      glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein 
      kinase (AMPK). The metabolomics results revealed that after treatment with HD, 
      the levels of L-carnitine, 1-methyladenosine, 1-methylhistamine, and 
      3-indoleacrylic acid were upregulated and the levels of riboflavin, 
      phenylalanine, atrolactic acid, 2-oxoglutarate, citrate, isocitrate, cortisol, 
      and glucose were downregulated. The main mechanism may be closely related to the 
      regulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, phenylalanine metabolism, 
      glyoxylate metabolism, and dicarboxylate metabolism. Additionally, it was also 
      found that HD can regulate the protein expression of GLUT4 and AMPK to interfere 
      with TCA cycle and carbohydrate metabolism to treat T2DM.

TI  - Inhibition of cytokine signaling in human retinal endothelial cells through 
      modification of caveolae/lipid rafts by docosahexaenoic acid.
PG  - 18-26
AB  - PURPOSE: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA(22:6,n3)) is the principal n3 polyunsaturated 
      fatty acid (PUFA) in the retina. The authors previously demonstrated that 
      DHA(22:6,n3) inhibited cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in primary 
      human retinal vascular endothelial (hRVE) cells, the target tissue affected by 
      diabetic retinopathy. Despite the importance of vascular inflammation in diabetic 
      retinopathy, the mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory effects of DHA(22:6,n3) 
      in vascular endothelial cells are not understood. In this study the authors 
      address the hypothesis that DHA(22:6,n3) acts through modifying lipid composition 
      of caveolae/lipid rafts, thereby changing the outcome of important signaling 
      events in these specialized plasma membrane microdomains. METHODS: hRVE cells 
      were cultured in the presence or absence of DHA(22:6,n3). Isolated caveolae/lipid 
      raft-enriched detergent-resistant membrane domains were prepared using sucrose 
      gradient ultracentrifugation. Fatty acid composition and cholesterol content of 
      caveolae/lipid rafts before and after treatment were measured by HPLC. The 
      expression of Src family kinases was assayed by Western blotting and 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Disruption of the caveolae/lipid raft structure 
      with a cholesterol-depleting agent, methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD), diminished 
      cytokine-induced signaling in hRVE cells. Growth of hRVE cells in media enriched 
      in DHA(22:6,n3) resulted in significant incorporation of DHA(22:6,n3) into the 
      major phospholipids of caveolae/lipid rafts, causing an increase in the 
      unsaturation index in the membrane microdomain. DHA(22:6,n3) enrichment in the 
      caveolae/raft was accompanied by a 70% depletion of cholesterol from 
      caveolae/lipid rafts and displacement of the SFK, Fyn, and c-Yes from 
      caveolae/lipid rafts. Adding water-soluble cholesterol to DHA(22:6,n3)-treated 
      cells replenished cholesterol in caveolae/lipid rafts and reversed the effect of 
      DHA(22:6,n3) on cytokine-induced signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of 
      DHA(22:6,n3) into fatty acyl chains of phospholipids in caveolae/lipid rafts, 
      followed by cholesterol depletion and displacement of important signaling 
      molecules, provides a potential mechanism for anti-inflammatory effect of 
      DHA(22:6,n3) in hRVE cells.

AB  - Renal tubular secretion is an important pathway for the elimination of many 
      clinically used drugs. Metformin, a commonly prescribed first-line antidiabetic 
      drug, is secreted primarily by the renal tubule. Many patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving metformin may together be given selective β1 
      blockers (e.g., atenolol). Therefore, it is of great use to evaluate the effect 
      of atenolol on metformin urinary excretion for exploring drug interactions and 
      predicting the adverse effect of drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate 
      the effect of atenolol on the pharmacokinetic of metformin and plasma lactate 
      (LCA) level in rats, for high LCA is a serious adverse reaction of metformin 
      after long-term metformin treatment. In this study, rats were treated with 
      metformin alone or in combination with atenolol. Plasma, urine and tissue 
      concentration of metformin was determined by HPLC method, while Western blotting 
      and immunohistochemical analysis were used to evaluate the renal expression of 
      rat organic cation transporter 2 (rOct2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion 
      protein 1 (rMate1). The results showed that, after 7 days drug treatment, the 
      AUC0 → t of metformin in atenolol and metformin co-administration group was 
      significantly increased by 19.5% compared to that in metformin group, while the 
      24h cumulative urinary excretion of metformin was significantly decreased by 
      57.3%. In addition, atenolol treatment significantly decreased the renal 
      expression of rMate1, but had no effect on rOct2 expression, renal blood 
      perfusion and glomerular filtration. Moreover, plasma LCA level in atenolol and 
      metformin co-administration group was significantly increased by 83.3% compared 
      to that in metformin group after 60 days drug treatment. These results indicated 
      that atenolol can inhibit urinary excretion of metformin via decreasing renal 
      rMate1 expression, and long-term atenolol and metformin co-administration may 
      induce potential lactic acidosis. Our results, for the first time, provided an 
      important experimental evidence that rMate1 is the target of transporter-mediated 
      drug interactions concerning metformin and atenolol.

AB  - A nucleic acid sequence MC, encoding Momordica Chanrantia anti-hyperglycaemic 
      peptide MC6 (accession: AAX06814) synthesized according to Escherichia coli 
      preferred codons, was cloned and expressed in E. coli. Recombinant protein 
      pQE8-MC (about 3.5 kDa) was purified and analyzed by 20% SDS-PAGE and western 
      blot. It revealed that the expressed pQE8-MC had good solubility in aqueous 
      media. An HPLC assay was used to confirm the expression of pQE8-MC. Subsequent 
      pharmacological activity assay revealed a significant hypoglycemic effect of low 
      dose treatments of pQE8-MC on male kunming mice. Four hours after an intravenous 
      tail injection, the blood sugar levels of mice treated with pQE8-MC saline 
      solution A3 (1 mg/kg BW) decreased greatly (P < 0.01) relative to the levels of a 
      control group. This suggests that pQE8-MC, expressed in bioengineered E. coli, 
      has a similar hypoglycemic function to the natural protein MC6 from M. 
      Chanrantia. These results reveal the possibility of using bio-engineered bacteria 
      as an anti-diabetic agent.

TI  - Argpyrimidine, a blue fluorophore in human lens proteins: high levels in 
      brunescent cataractous lenses.
PG  - 1299-304
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the human lens contains argpyrimidine, a 
      modification of arginine by methylglyoxal, to establish how argpyrimidine content 
      relates to lens aging and cataract formation. METHODS: A monoclonal antibody was 
      used to measure argpyrimidine by a competitive ELISA in water soluble (WS) and 
      insoluble (WI) lens fractions from young, aged, nuclear cataractous, and 
      brunescent cataractous lenses. Brunescent cataractous lens proteins were digested 
      by enzymes, the digest was subjected to HPLC, and the eluate was analyzed for 
      argpyrimidine. Lens proteins from aged lenses (from donors 65 to 80 years of age) 
      were fractionated on a Sephadex G-200 column, and the crystallins were tested for 
      argpyrimidine. RESULTS: The competitive ELISA showed two to three times as much 
      argpyrimidine in water-insoluble proteins as in water-soluble proteins. Although 
      no clear cut increase with the age of the lens donors in either the water-soluble 
      or the insoluble protein fractions was found, the argpyrimidine levels in 
      brunescent cataractous lenses were significantly higher (254.0 +/- 155 pmol/mg 
      protein, P < 0.005) than in age-matched, aged (16.1 +/- 8 pmol/mg) or nuclear 
      cataractous lenses (49.0 +/- 26 pmol/mg). Lenses from diabetic individuals showed 
      a modest increase (50.3 pmol/mg) compared with age-matched normal lenses. HPLC 
      results provided additional evidence that human lenses contain argpyrimidine. 
      Western blotting experiments showed consistently stronger reactions with 
      cataractous lens proteins than those from noncataractous lenses, and 
      argpyrimidine was found in both crystallin monomers and polymers. All crystallins 
      and several cross-linked high-molecular-weight aggregates reacted with the 
      antibody to argpyrimidine, but a protein of approximately 28 kDa in the 
      alpha-crystallin fraction displayed the greatest immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Methylglyoxal modifies arginine within the human lens, and the changes occur at a 
      much higher rate in brunescent lens proteins than in either nuclear cataractous 
      or normal lenses. All crystallins contained argpyrimidine and covalently 
      cross-linked aggregates. This is the first report of immunologic evidence for an 
      arginine modification in the human lens by a physiologically important 
      alpha-dicarbonyl compound.

TI  - Degradation of intraendosomal insulin by insulin-degrading enzyme without 
      acidification.
PG  - 436-43
AB  - The nature of insulin degradation within endosomes was studied in vitro. 
      Radiolabeled insulin was perfused into rat liver via the portal vein, and 
      insulin-containing endosomes were prepared by differential centrifugation. The 
      endosomes were incubated in various buffers, and hormone degradation was 
      monitored by Sephadex G-50 chromatography and high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC). Endosomes incubated in simple imidazole or HEPES (pH 7.4) 
      buffers rapidly degraded insulin to intermediate- and then to 
      low-molecular-weight products that were lost from the vesicles. HPLC analysis of 
      insulin-sized material showed the products to be the same as those produced by 
      intact cells. The endosomes did not acidify in these buffers (as assessed by the 
      acridine orange method), and ATP had no effects. When the endosomes were 
      incubated in a chloride-containing buffer, degradation was greatly inhibited, and 
      acidification did not occur. Both insulin degradation and acidification were 
      activated when Mg-ATP was added to this buffer system. HPLC analysis of the 
      products generated in this system revealed not only typical cellular products but 
      additional less hydrophobic products. Western-blot analysis of endosomal protein 
      with anti-insulin-degrading enzyme antibody showed this enzyme to be present. In 
      conclusion, isolated endosomes rapidly and completely degrade insulin through 
      products that are typical of cellular degradation without requiring 
      acidification. Chloride-containing buffers inhibit endosomal degradation, which 
      is reversed by Mg-ATP, but this system does not mimic cellular degradation. At 
      least one of the enzymes responsible for insulin degradation is insulin-degrading 
      enzyme.

TI  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of nitric oxide synthase-2 and 
      cyclooxygenase-2 is impaired in fructose overloaded rats.
PG  - 307-13
LID - 10.1016/j.lfs.2010.12.005 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Fructose (F) overload in rats induces metabolic dysfunctions that resemble 
      the human metabolic syndrome. In this paper, we aimed to investigate the response 
      of F overload rats to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in terms of nitric oxide 
      (NO) production and prostanoids (PR) release. MAIN METHODS: NO blood steady-state 
      concentration was monitored through the detection of nitrosyl-hemoglobin 
      complexes (NO-Hb) by electronic spin resonance. Production of 6-keto PGF(1)α, 
      PGE(2), PGF(2)α and TXB(2) was measured in aorta and mesenteric beds by HPLC. 
      Western blot analysis was used to examine the changes in the expression levels of 
      NOS-2 and COX-2 in aorta. KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that increases in NO 
      circulating steady-state concentration and PR production by aorta and mesenteric 
      beds 6h after LPS administration were significantly attenuated in F overload rats 
      with respect to control animals. Oxidative stress parameters were equally 
      affected in the presence or absence of the F treatment. Aorta protein levels of 
      NOS-2 and COX-2, two enzymes inducible by LPS, were significantly lower in F 
      overload rats with respect to control rats at the end of the treatment (-39% and 
      -61% for NOS-2 and COX-2 respectively). SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that 
      the metabolic alterations established by 15 weeks of F overload should affect the 
      response to LPS challenge due to an attenuation in the induction of NOS-2 and 
      COX-2. This effect would be one of the components contributing to abnormalities 
      in the course of the inflammatory response in other conditions associated to 
      insulin resistance, such as diabetes.

TI  - Increases in renal epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine crosslinks result from 
      compartment-specific changes in tissue transglutaminase in early experimental 
      diabetic nephropathy: pathologic implications.
PG  - 705-16
AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is characterized by an early, progressive expansion and 
      sclerosis of the glomerular mesangium leading to glomerulosclerosis. This is 
      associated with parallel fibrosis of the renal interstitium. In experimental 
      renal scarring, the protein cross-linking enzyme, tissue transglutaminase (tTg), 
      is up-regulated and externalized causing an increase in its crosslink product, 
      epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine, in the extracellular space. This potentially 
      contributes to the extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation central to tissue 
      fibrosis by increasing deposition and inhibiting breakdown. We investigated if a 
      similar mechanism may contribute to the ECM expansion characteristic of DN using 
      the rat streptozotocin model over 120 days. Whole kidney 
      epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)-lysine (HPLC analysis) was significantly increased from 
      Day 90 (+337%) and peaked at Day 120 (+650%) (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence 
      showed this increase to be predominantly extracellular in the peritubular 
      interstitial space, but also in individual glomeruli. Total kidney 
      transglutaminase (Tg) was not elevated. However, using a Tg in situ activity 
      assay, increased Tg was detected in both the extracellular interstitial space and 
      glomeruli by Day 60, with a maximal 53% increase at Day 120 (p < 0.05). Using a 
      specific anti-tTg antibody, immunohistochemistry showed a similar increase in 
      extracellular enzyme in the interstitium and glomeruli. To biochemically 
      characterize glomerular changes, glomeruli were isolated by selective sieving. In 
      line with whole kidney measurement, there was an increase in glomerular 
      epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine (+361%); however, in the glomeruli this was 
      associated with increases in Tg activity (+228%) and tTg antigen by Western 
      blotting (+215%). Importantly, the ratio of glomerular epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) 
      lysine to hydroxyproline increased by 2.2-fold. In DN, changes in the kidney 
      result in increased translocation of tTg to the extracellular environment where 
      high Ca(2+) and low GTP levels allow its activation. In the tubulointerstitium 
      this is independent of increased tTg production, but dependent in the glomerulus. 
      This leads to excessive ECM cross-linking, contributing to the renal fibrosis 
      characteristic of progressive DN.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gentiana scabra root extract (GS) is frequently 
      prescribed as an internal remedy in traditional Korean medicine for treatment of 
      diabetes mellitus. GS contains bitter iridoid glycosides including loganic acid, 
      gentiopicrin, trifloroside, and rindoside. We previously reported that the 
      intestinal bitter taste sensation stimulates GLP-1 secretion, and thereupon 
      hypothesized that the blood glucose regulatory effect of GS is due to its GLP-1 
      secreting effect in enteroendocrine L cells. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We studied 
      GLP-1 secreting effect of GS treatment and its cellular downstream mechanism in 
      human enteroendocrine NCI-H716 cells using the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 
      pathway inhibitors. Intracellular calcium assay also demonstrated the signal 
      transduction pathway stimulated by the GS treatment. Using db/db mice, we 
      performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to examine the blood glucose 
      lowering effect of GS administration. We also collected the mouse plasma during 
      the OGTT to measure the GLP-1 and insulin levels. RESULT: We demonstrated 
      dose-dependent GLP-1 secreting effect of GS on the NCI-H716 cells. The GLP-1 
      secreting effect of GS is mediated by the G protein βγ-subunit and inositol 
      triphosphate. Using db/db mice, we found that the effect of GS on lowering blood 
      glucose is due to its GLP-1 secretion, and consequential insulinotropic effect. 
      The chemical fingerprint of GS was obtained through a direct analysis in realtime 
      mass spectrometry (DART-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/MS. 
      Through the GLP-1 secretion study, we found that loganic acid, an iridoid 
      glycoside, contributes to the GLP-1 secreting effect of GS. CONCLUSION: The 
      findings of this study highlight the potential of exploiting the antidiabetic 
      effect of GS on type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

TI  - Establishment of pressurized-liquid extraction by response surface methodology 
      approach coupled to HPLC-DAD-TOF-MS for the determination of phenolic compounds 
      of myrtle leaves.
PG  - 3547-3557

AB  - Myrtus communis L. (myrtle) is native to the Mediterranean region and Western 
      Asia. Its leaves have demonstrated its potential effect towards different 
      bioactivities like anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheic, anti-ulcer, anti-cancer, among 
      others. These activities have been associated with its phenolic content. In this 
      sense, the aim of this work has been to develop a new pressurized-liquid 
      extraction procedure (PLE), by using a response surface methodology (RSM), to 
      evaluate the phenolic composition from myrtle leaves by HPLC-DAD-TOF-MS. 
      Previously, different solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and acetone/water 
      mixtures were tested by using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) in order to 
      select the most suitable one. Subsequently, a Box-Behnken design (BBD) was 
      performed according to the effect of ethanol/water ratio (50, 75, and 100% 
      (v/v)), temperature (50, 125, and 200 °C), and extraction time (5, 18, and 
      30 min). The optimal conditions achieved with the established method were 71% 
      ethanol/water, 137 °C, and 19 min. The analysis of the obtained extracts by 
      HPLC-DAD-TOF-MS allowed the characterization of 15 new compounds in myrtle 
      leaves. Finally, high amounts of gallic and ellagic acid were found in the 
      optimized PLE extracts (3.31 ± 0.03 and 3.88 ± 0.09 mg/g leaf dry weight (d.w.), 
      respectively), and PLE reported greater recovery of total phenolic compounds than 
      UAE (30 ± 1 and 22.4 ± 0.6 mg/g leaf d.w., respectively).

AB  - Based upon the lack of clinical samples available for research in many 
      laboratories worldwide, a significant gap exists between basic and clinical 
      studies of beta-thalassemia major. To bridge this gap, we developed an 
      artificially engineered model for human beta thalassemia by knocking down 
      beta-globin gene and protein expression in cultured CD34+ cells obtained from 
      healthy adults. Lentiviral-mediated transduction of beta-globin shRNA (beta-KD) 
      caused imbalanced globin chain production. Beta-globin mRNA was reduced by 90% 
      compared to controls, while alpha-globin mRNA levels were maintained. HPLC 
      analyses revealed a 96% reduction in HbA with only a minor increase in HbF. 
      During the terminal phases of differentiation (culture days 14-21), beta-KD cells 
      demonstrated increased levels of insoluble alpha-globin, as well as activated 
      caspase-3. The majority of the beta-KD cells underwent apoptosis around the 
      polychromatophilic stage of maturation. GDF15, a marker of ineffective 
      erythropoiesis in humans with thalassemia, was significantly increased in the 
      culture supernatants from the beta-KD cells. Knockdown of beta-globin expression 
      in cultured primary human erythroblasts provides a robust ex vivo model for 
      beta-thalassemia.

AB  - Retinal capillary pericyte degeneration has been linked to aldose reductase (AR) 
      activity in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Since the development of DR in mice and 
      rats has been reported to differ and that this may be linked to differences in 
      retinal sorbitol levels, we have established new murine models of early onset 
      diabetes mellitus as tools for investigating the role of AR in DR. Transgenic 
      diabetic mouse models were developed by crossbreeding diabetic 
      C57BL/6-Ins2(Akita)/J (AK) with transgenic C57BL mice expressing green 
      fluorescent protein (GFP), human aldose reductase (hAR) or both in vascular 
      tissues containing smooth muscle actin-α (SMAA). Changes in retinal sorbitol 
      levels were determined by HPLC while changes of growth factors and signaling were 
      investigated by Western Blots. Retinal vascular changes were quantitatively 
      analyzed on elastase-digestion flat mounts. Results show that sorbitol levels 
      were higher in neural retinas of diabetic AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR compared to AK-SMAA-GFP 
      mice. AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR mice showed induction of the retinal growth factors VEGF, 
      IGF-1, bFGF and TGFβ, as well as signaling changes in P-Akt, P-SAPK/JNK, and 
      P-44/42 MAPK. Increased loss of nuclei per capillary length and a significant 
      increase in the percentage of acellular capillaries presented in 18 week old 
      AK-SMAA-GFP-hAR mice. These changes are similar to those observed in 
      streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Retinal changes in both mice and rats were 
      prevented by inhibition of AR. These studies confirm that the increased 
      expression of AR in mice results in the development of retinal changes associated 
      with the early stages of DR that are similar to those observed in rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the metabolism of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), one of lipid 
      derived aldehydes (LDAs), in diabetic rat lens and its role in diabetic cataract 
      formation. METHODS: Experimental research. A factor design was used to set up the 
      experiment statistically upon two factors: diabetic and normal control as 
      treatment factors; day 30, 45 and 70 as the time factors. Normal and diabetic 
      rats' lenses were incubated with HNE for 2 hours. HNE metabolites in the culture 
      media were studied by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Aldehyde 
      dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in normal and diabetic rat lens (30, 45 and 70 d 
      after inducing of cataract) was detected by a spectrophotometer, ALDH protein and 
      HNE-protein were detected by Western Blot. All data were analyzed by the 
      Bonferroni test using SAS 8.0 software. RESULTS: The major pathway for HNE 
      metabolism in normal lens was conjugation with glutathione (GSH) to form GS-HNE 
      (45%), followed by HNE's oxidation to 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid (HNA) by ALDH, 
      which accounted for approximately 9.1% of HNE. The conjugation of HNE with GSH in 
      diabetic lens was decreased approximately 64% at day 30 compared with the 
      controls (F = 49.59, P < 0.001). The pathway of HNE oxidation by ALDH in the 
      diabetic lens was enhanced approximately 1.7 times at day 70 compared to day 30 
      (F = 11.51, P = 0.0442). A higher ALDH activity, greater amount of ALDH protein, 
      and less amount of HNE-protein adduct were presented in diabetic rat lens. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The pathway of conjugation of HNE with GSH is inhibited in diabetic 
      lens which may play a role in the formation of diabetic cataract. The oxidation 
      of HNE by ALDH is a compensation process for protecting the lens against diabetic 
      damage.

TI  - Heterozygous mutation within a kinase-conserved motif of the insulin-like growth 
      factor I receptor causes intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation.
PG  - 1137-42
LID - 10.1210/jc.2009-1433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: IGF-I receptor (IGF1R) plays an essential role in human intrauterine 
      and postnatal development. Few heterozygous mutations in IGF1R leading to IGF-I 
      resistance and intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation have been described 
      to date. OBJECTIVE: The clinical and functional relevance of a novel heterozygous 
      IGF1R mutation identified in a girl with short stature and six relatives was 
      evaluated. PATIENTS: Affected individuals showed birth lengths between -1.40 and 
      -1.82 sd score (SDS) and birth weights between -1.84 and -2.19 SDS. Postnatal 
      growth retardation ranged between -1.51 and -3.93 height SDS. Additional 
      phenotypic findings were variable including microcephaly, clinodactyly, delayed 
      menarche, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Genetic analyses were initiated due to 
      elevated IGF-I levels of the girl. RESULTS: Denaturing HPLC screening and direct 
      DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous G3464C IGF1R mutation in exon 19 located 
      within a phylogenetically conserved motif of the kinase domain. The resultant 
      mutation of glycine 1125 to alanine (G1125A) did not affect IGF1R protein 
      expression in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and Igf1R deficient mouse 
      fibroblasts but abrogated IGF-I-induced receptor autophosphorylation and 
      phosphorylation of downstream kinases protein kinase B/Akt and MAPK/Erk (mouse 
      proteins are reported). Cotransfection of wild-type and mutant IGF1R resulted in 
      reduced autophosphorylation of 36 +/- 10% of wild-type levels, suggesting a 
      partial dominant-negative effect. CONCLUSION: The identified G1125A mutation 
      results in a kinase-deficient IGF1R, which is likely to cause the phenotype of 
      intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation.

TI  - Transfection of pancreatic-derived beta-cells with a minigene encoding for human 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 regulates glucose-dependent insulin synthesis and 
      secretion.
PG  - 3529-39
AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone derived from the 
      proglucagon gene, capable of regulating the transcription of the three major 
      genes that determine the pancreatic beta-cell-specific phenotype: insulin, 
      GLUT-2, and glucokinase. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential 
      role of GLP-1 for the gene therapy of glucose-insensitive pancreatic beta-cells. 
      We transfected mouse insulinoma cells with a DNA fragment of the human 
      proglucagon gene containing the nucleotide sequence encoding for human GLP-1 but 
      lacking the coding region for glucagon. Two constructs were generated: In one, 
      the expression of GLP-1 was under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
      promoter (CMV/GLP-1), and the second was regulated by the rat insulin II promoter 
      (RIP)/GLP-1). Northern blot, HPLC, and RIA analyses confirmed that the minigene 
      was transcribed and the protein appropriately translated, processed, and secreted 
      in the extracellular environment. Gene expression studies revealed that although 
      CMV/GLP-1 cells did not gain a greater glucose sensitivity as a result of the 
      transfection with GLP-1, compared with cells transfected with the plasmid alone, 
      RIP/GLP-1 was capable of regulating the gene expression of insulin and GLP-1 
      based on the concentration of glucose in the culture medium. Detection of the 
      counterpart proteins (insulin and GLP-1) in the culture medium paralleled the 
      observation derived from the Northern blot analysis. GLP-1 action was mediated by 
      an IDX-1 (islet/duodenum homeobox-1) dependent transactivation of the endogenous 
      insulin promoter, as demonstrated by gel shift analysis. This was further 
      suggested by a significant increase of the glucose-dependent binding of IDX-1 to 
      the insulin promoter in RIP/GLP-1 cells but not in CMV/GLP-1 cells or control 
      cells. Finally, we observed that although the GLP-1-dependent secretion of 
      insulin was mediated by an increase in cAMP levels, the transcription of the 
      insulin gene, in response to GLP-1, was in large part cAMP independent. The 
      present study lays the research foundation to investigate the potential use of 
      GLP-1 for the gene or cell therapy of diabetes.

TI  - Enhanced insulin secretion from engineered 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by induction of 
      cellular differentiation.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - We have established insulin-secreting cell line, L1-INS/fur cells, by engineering 
      3T3-L1 murine preadipocytes with human preproinsulin cDNA. Analysis with HPLC, 
      mass spectrometry and immunological assay identified human insulin in the culture 
      medium. Notably, secretion of insulin from L1-INS/fur cell was increased 8.2 
      times higher after induction of cellular differentiation. The increment of 
      insulin secretion during differentiation was further enhanced by additive 
      treatment with thiazolidinedione, a promoting agent of adipocyte differentiation. 
      This observation strongly suggests that the enhancement of insulin secretion is 
      tightly associated with cellular differentiation process itself. Expression rate 
      of the insulin transgene was not changed after the additional treatment with 
      thiazolidinedione. On the other hand, furin gene expression by Northern analysis 
      showed an increase, and Western analysis revealed even more reduction in cellular 
      content of proinsulin. These results indicate that mechanism of the observed 
      enhancement in insulin secretion during the differentiation is mainly due to 
      increased capacity of the proinsulin processing by induction of furin. Results of 
      our present study will provide important information on cell-based therapy using 
      undifferentiated progenitors and tissue stem cells.

TI  - Characterization of the unusual insulin of Psammomys obesus, a rodent with 
      nutrition-induced NIDDM-like syndrome.
PG  - 953-7
AB  - Psammomys obesus fed a high-calorie diet develops a NIDDM-like syndrome. The use 
      of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to study Psammomys 
      insulin biosynthesis and release revealed a very delayed elution time for the 
      Psammomys insulin peak appearing near the position of human proinsulin. This 
      unusual peak was initially thought to represent partially processed insulin on 
      the basis of its molecular size and susceptibility to trimming by 
      carboxypeptidase B (CpB). However, the findings of an active carboxypeptidase E 
      (CpE) enzyme and the normal amidated forms of gastrin and cholecystokinin 
      octapeptide (CCK-8) in Psammomys tissues were inconsistent with CpE-related 
      aberrant processing of insulin. Moreover, amino acid sequencing of the delayed 
      peak of Psammomys insulin revealed fully processed insulin with amino acid 
      sequence as predicted by the cDNA. The unique presence of a B-30 phenylalanine 
      residue, resulting in an increased hydrophobicity of the insulin molecule, 
      probably underlies the marked delay in elution time on HPLC. The unusual 
      structure of Psammomys insulin does not appear to contribute to the 
      proinsulinemia observed in diabetic Psammomys since the HPLC-purified molecule 
      did not inhibit PC1 and PC2 convertase activities in an in vitro assay.

TI  - Purification, cloning and expression of dehydroascorbic acid-reducing activity 
      from human neutrophils: identification as glutaredoxin.
PG  - 931-8
AB  - Dehydroascorbic acid-reducing activity in normal human neutrophil lysates was 
      characterized and identified by activity-based purification and measurement of 
      newly synthesized ascorbate by HPLC. The initial reducing activity was 
      non-dialysable and could not be accounted for by the activity of glutathione as a 
      reducing agent. The reducing activity was purified to homogeneity as an 11 kDa 
      protein. The protein had a specific activity of 3 mumol/min per mg of protein and 
      was glutathione dependent. Kinetic experiments showed that the protein had a K(m) 
      for glutathione of 2.0 mM and a K(m) for dehydroascorbic acid of 250 microM. 
      Dehydroascorbic acid reduction by the purified protein was pH dependent and was 
      maximal at pH 7.5. Peptide fragments from the purified protein were analysed for 
      amino acid sequence and the protein was identified as glutaredoxin. By using 
      degenerate oligonucleotides based on the amino acid sequence, glutaredoxin was 
      cloned from a human neutrophil library. Expressed purified glutaredoxin displayed 
      reducing activity and kinetics that were indistinguishable from those of native 
      purified enzyme. Several approaches indicated that glutaredoxin was responsible 
      for the most of the protein-mediated dehydroascorbic acid reduction in lysates. 
      From protein purification data, glutaredoxin was responsible for at least 47% of 
      the initial reducing activity. Dehydroascorbic acid reduction was at least 5-fold 
      greater in neutrophil lysates than in myeloid tumour cell lysates, and 
      glutaredoxin was detected in normal neutrophil lysates but not in myeloid tumour 
      cell lysates by Western blotting. Glutaredoxin inhibitors inhibited 
      dehydroascorbic acid reduction in neutrophil lysates as much as 80%. These 
      findings indicate that glutaredoxin plays a major role in dehydroascorbic acid 
      reduction in normal human neutrophil lysates, and represent the first 
      identification of dehydroascorbic acid reductase in human tissue by 
      activity-based purification.

TI  - High-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection of antioxidants 
      in vertebrate lens: glutathione, tocopherol, and ascorbate.
PG  - 523-39
AB  - The HPLC-EC method has good specificity for the analysis of glutathione, 
      tocopherol, and ascorbate. The same HPLC system can be used for all three 
      analysis with changes of mobile phase and the electrode cell to match the 
      procedure required. The same C18 reversed-phase column has been used with a 
      refillable guard column for 3 years with no noticeable loss of resolving power. 
      The main advantage of the glutathione procedure was the ability to monitor both 
      GSH and GSSG, which allowed us to confirm that loss of GSH in the diabetic rat 
      lens does not result in the appearance of GSSG. The main benefit of the 
      tocopherol procedure was the ability to measure the tocopherol content of a 
      single rat lens. Our previous experience with UV or fluorescence detection showed 
      those methods to be not sensitive enough for a single lens determination. The 
      mammalian lens has the lowest tocopherol content of the tissues of the eye, 10 to 
      40 times less than most body tissues as measured by gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (GC-MS). The better sensitivity of electrochemical detection has 
      allowed for a single lens determination, keeping the number of experimental 
      animals to a minimum. An advantage of the ASC analysis procedure was the extra 
      specificity imparted by both the chromatography and the detector as well as the 
      ability to estimate the total ascorbate (ASC plus DHAA) and DHAA content. Other 
      reducing agents such as GSH and uric acid can interfere in colorimetric methods 
      that rely on the reducing action of ASC. The very high GSH content of the 
      mammalian lens was a concern when choosing a procedure. GSH levels exceeding 10 
      times the level of lens samples were found to yield no response using the HPLC-EC 
      procedure for ASC. The only disadvantage with electrochemical detection was that 
      the electrode response could drift with time, requiring more frequent calibration 
      with standards. We continue to utilize these methods to examine the prevacuole 
      loss of ASC and GSH in the diabetic rat lens model of cataract.

TI  - Analysis of eluted peptides from type 1 diabetes-susceptible HLA class II 
      molecules identified novel islet protein, heparin/heparan sulfate-interacting 
      protein.
PG  - 356-61
AB  - Identification of peptides derived from pancreatic islet and presented by type 1 
      diabetes-susceptible MHC class II molecules has great significance to elucidate 
      the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. A bulk culture of Epstein-Barr 
      virus-transformed B-cells, which were established from a 22-year-old type 1 
      diabetic woman with HLA-DR4 and -DQw8, was pulsed with the homogenate of a human 
      embryonic pancreas-derived cell line 1B2C6, and another culture was not pulsed 
      with antigen. Peptide fractions were obtained by treatment of affinity-purified 
      HLA-DR and -DQ molecules with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and were subjected to 
      reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The RP-HPLC 
      profiles of peptides derived from DR molecules revealed three peaks that 
      specifically appeared after pulsing, but no such peaks were obtained from DQ 
      molecules. From one of these three peaks, a peptide that consisted of 14 amino 
      acids (AKSXNHTXXNQXRK, where X represents the undetermined amino acids) was 
      identified. This peptide was derived from heparin/heparan sulfate-interacting 
      protein (HIP). Immunostaining of pancreatic sections using antiserum for HIP 
      peptide revealed exclusive staining of the islets. Thus, HIP was identified as an 
      islet protein naturally processed and presented by HLA-DR4 molecules.

TI  - The fate of gamma L crystallins in rat lens during diabetic cataractogenesis as 
      determined by a monoclonal antibody.
PG  - 989-96
LID - 10.3109/02713688908997391 [doi]
AB  - We developed a monoclonal antibody against HPLC purified rat lens gamma L 
      crystallins. This antibody was specific to both the polypeptides (19,000 and 
      21,000 daltons) which constituted the HPLC gamma L peak. Least reactivity was 
      shown against gamma H (24,000 daltons). This antibody was used as a probe to 
      detect the presence of and quantitate gamma L crystallins in lens soluble, 
      insoluble and urea-insoluble fractions during diabetes. Utilizing a direct 
      binding immunoassay (ELISA) we calculated the absolute quantities of gamma L 
      crystallins present in these fractions. Our results show, in normal animals there 
      was a minimal change in total quantities of gamma L crystallins in soluble 
      fraction from 1 month to 5 months of age, but a slow accumulation of these 
      crystallins in insoluble and urea-insoluble fractions was seen during the same 
      period. Diabetes resulted in a depletion of gamma L crystallins from the soluble 
      fraction, both in terms of relative proportion and absolute quantities. In 
      insoluble and urea-insoluble fractions the relative proportions of these 
      crystallins were increased dramatically up until 60 days followed by a decrease 
      during 90-120 days of diabetes, whereas, the absolute quantities remained more or 
      less steady after reaching the maximum on 60 days. Although the relative 
      proportions of gamma L crystallins in the insoluble fraction seem to be less when 
      compared to urea-insoluble fraction, the total quantity of these crystallins was 
      much higher due to abundance of this fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Increased fetal hemoglobin in insulin-treated diabetes mellitus contributes to 
      the imprecision of glycohemoglobin measurements.
PG  - 833-5
AB  - An increased prevalence of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has been described in pediatric 
      insulin-dependent patients. The popular electroendosmotic method for 
      glycohemoglobin includes HbF. In an adult population comprising 50 
      insulin-treated and 57 non-insulin-treated diabetic patients and 57 control 
      subjects, we measured HbF by HPLC and measured glycohemoglobin by both HPLC and 
      an electroendosmotic method. Of the insulin-treated patients, 46% had 
      concentrations of HbF > or = 0.5%, compared with 25% of non-insulin-treated 
      patients and 23% of controls (P < 0.02). In the insulin-treated patients, the two 
      glycohemoglobin methods correlated best when the HPLC measurements included HbF 
      (r = 0.92 vs r = 0.84). Fructosamine concentrations correlated best with 
      glycohemoglobin concentrations determined by methods that accounted for HbF. The 
      true between-batch CV of the electroendosmotic assay increased (from 4.33% to 
      8.33%) when variable interpatient HbF concentrations were included. Thus, HbF 
      must be considered when interpreting glycohemoglobin measured by an 
      electroendosmotic method and when comparing it with other measures of glycemic 
      control.

TI  - The advanced glycation endproduct pentosidine and monocyte activation in uremia.
PG  - 379-82
AB  - RATIONALE: Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) contribute to the pathogenesis 
      of vascular complications in diabetes, aging and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
      Immune abnormalities in patients with chronic renal failure and those treated by 
      dialysis contribute to high rates of morbidity and mortality. We therefore sought 
      a relationship between a circulating marker of immune dysfunction and plasma 
      levels of the AGE pentosidine. METHOD: We studied non-diabetic patients with mild 
      to advanced renal failure (n = 60), and with ESRD treated by hemodialysis (HD) (n 
      = 44) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) (n = 19). The plasma protein content of the 
      well characterized AGE, pentosidine was measured using HPLC. In the same samples 
      the monocyte activation product neopterin was measured by RIA. RESULTS: Plasma 
      levels of pentosidine and neopterin increased in parallel with the progression of 
      renal failure. Pentosidine and neopterin were highly correlated in all patients 
      even after adjustment for Ccr. This correlation was also present in patients with 
      ESRD. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the AGE pentosidine is associated with 
      monocyte activation in renal failure, an interaction which may contribute to 
      accelerated rates of complication and death by as yet unknown mechanisms.

PG  - 187-98
AB  - A possible contribution to cell toxicity in the diabetic lens due to early ATP 
      loss is not well characterized prior to the appearance of vacuoles in the lens. 
      Changes in lens ATP levels at longer periods of hyperglycaemia (6-8 weeks) have 
      been reported. We used [31P]NMR analysis of lens extracts at three time periods, 
      comparing diabetic to concurrent control groups at 1, 2 and 4 weeks of 
      hyperglycaemia. With this design, significant alterations (> 10%) in the ATP/ADP 
      ratio can be monitored. NMR analysis revealed a decreased ATP/ADP ratio at all 
      time periods, averaging a 38% decrease. Luminescent determination of ATP levels 
      indicates that this decrease is mainly caused by a decrease of 25% in ATP 
      concentration. The early loss of GSH was large and not accompanied by an 
      appearance of GSSG, as monitored by HPLC electrochemical detection. A 1-week 
      experiment with animals receiving daily insulin treatment was carried out to 
      control for effects of STZ on the lens. This treatment resulted in normal lens 
      GSH levels and a near normal [31P]NMR profile.

TI  - [Urinary albumin fragmentation and immunoreactivity].
PG  - 124-30
AB  - Urinary albumin (ALB) has been measured as a marker for the early detection of 
      diabetic nephropathy. In 2004, Comper et al. developed a gel-filtration 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure for the determination of 
      urinary ALB. They demonstrated the presence in its albumin fraction of non 
      immunoreactive ALB with the total molecular weight of a monomeric ALB that was 
      non-reactive with the existing anti-ALB antibody, and reported that the level of 
      urinary non-immunoreactive ALB was higher in diabetic patients than in normal 
      subjects. In this study, we isolated urinary ALB from diabetic patients using an 
      anti-ALB antibody-coupled affinity column to test its immunoreactivity. In some 
      diabetic patients, the results of HPLC and turbidimetric immunoassay for urinary 
      ALB were discrepant. Western blot analysis showed that ALB samples from such 
      patients were contaminated with proteins other than ALB, and contained ALB, whose 
      molecular weight became lower using a reductive procedure. In addition, the 
      reactivity of ALB with anti-ALB antibody differed depending on whether it was in 
      a reduced or non-reduced state. These results indicate that ALB in such patients 
      is susceptible to structural changes due to disease-induced urinary factors and, 
      thus, their urine contains ALB with an altered reactivity to antibody.

TI  - Tritium isotope effect in high-pressure liquid chromatography of vitamin D 
      metabolites.
PG  - 137-41
AB  - A significant chromatographic isotope effect is reported for 
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in a wide variety of HPLC separation systems. The effect 
      is also observed for 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Retention times differ from less 
      than 1% up to 4% depending on the separation system and the degree and position 
      of tritium substitution. Such an effect must be corrected for whenever both 
      labeled and unlabeled vitamin D metabolites are used in HPLC cochromatography or 
      assay recovery studies.

TI  - Modelling cortical cataractogenesis 17: in vitro effect of a-lipoic acid on 
      glucose-induced lens membrane damage, a model of diabetic cataractogenesis.
PG  - 361-70
AB  - The effect of R, S, and racemic forms of a-lipoic acid was tested on the 
      formation of opacity in normal rat lenses incubated with 55.6 mM glucose, as a 
      model for in vivo diabetic cataractogenesis. Control lenses, incubated 8 days 
      with 5.56 mM glucose, did not develop opacities. Formation of lens opacities in 
      vitro was correlated with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage into the incubation 
      medium. Opacity formation and LDH leakage, resulting from incubation in medium 
      containing 55.6 mM glucose to model diabetes, were both suppressed by the 
      addition of 1 mM R-lipoic acid. Addition of 1 mM racemic lipoic acid reduces 
      these damaging effects to the lens by one-half, while S-lipoic acid potentiated 
      LDH leakage, consistent with the hypothesis that R-lipoic acid is the active 
      form. Although HPLC analysis demonstrated that both stereoisomers of lipoic acid 
      were reduced to dihydrolipoate at comparable rates by the intact lens, the 
      mitochondrial lipoamide dehydrogenase system is highly specific for reduction of 
      exogenous R-lipoic to dihydrolipoic acid. Therefore, stereospecific protection 
      against this opacity is consistent with specific reduction of R-lipoic acid in 
      mitochondria of the vulnerable cells at the lens equator where the first globular 
      degeneration is seen in glucose cataract.
